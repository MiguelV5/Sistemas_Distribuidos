0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,,A30TK6U7DNS82R,Kevin Killian,10/10,5.0,1095724800,Really Enjoyed It,"I don't care much for Dr. Seuss but after reading Philip Nel's book I changed my mind--that's a good testimonial to the power of Rel's writing and thinking. Rel plays Dr. Seuss the ultimate compliment of treating him as a serious poet as well as one of the 20th century's most interesting visual artists, and after reading his book I decided that a trip to the Mandeville Collections of the library at University of California in San Diego was in order, so I could visit some of the incredible Seuss/Geisel holdings they have there.There's almost too much to take in, for, like William Butler Yeats, Seuss led a career that constantly shifted and metamoprhized itself to meet new historical and political cirsumstances, so he seems to have been both a leftist and a conservative at different junctures of his career, both in politics and in art. As Nel shows us, he was once a cartoonist for the fabled PM magazine and, like Andy Warhol, he served his time slaving in the ad business too. All was in the service of amusing and broadening the minds of US children. Nel doesn't hesitate to administer a sound spanking to the Seuss industry that, since his death, has seen fit to license all kinds of awful products including the recent CAT IN THE HAT film with Mike Myers. Oh, what a cat-astrophe!The book is great and I can especially recommend the work of the picture editor who has given us a bounty of good illustrations."

B000KPCR8I,The Forever Machine,,,,11/14,2.0,925516800,Disapointed,"Book #2 in my read through the Hugo's. While I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;The Demolished Man&quot; by Alfred Bester, this novel comes across as being way too preachy. Seeking a telepathic companion, Joe Carter orchastrates the building of the first super-computer, named Bossy, that has the ability to renew mankind. Wash away their prejudices and preconcieved notions. And, I guess in the view of the authors, create a race of zombies with no convictions. Skip this one if you're looking for classic Sci-Fi."
B000KPCR8I,The Forever Machine,,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,Craig MACKINNON,1/1,4.0,1236124800,"A universal study of the human mind, unfortunately with some laughable science","As one of the earliest Hugo winners, I was willing to approach this book with an open mind - much of the speculative and scientific fiction of the '50s looks naive or simply contains erroneous science. This book contains such problems in spades. The idea that all human disease can be washed away through psychotherapy is laughable, and some of the other science is equally quaint. I'd even go so far as to say that the authors should have known better, even in the '50s, or that they misunderstood (perhaps delibrately) some of the basic laws of science. Fortunately, the science is really just the medium through which the story can be told. The real theme of this book is the nature of humanity. I'm afraid the authors have a very unflattering opinion of human nature!The story: Little ""Crazy Joe"" Carter is a telepath - an honest-to-goodness mind-reader. Unfortunately, since there is no scientific theory that can support the notion of telepathy, and in the highly politicized scientific commnuity of this future world, his abilities are dismissed the evidence ignored. Only a few free-thinkers accept the evidence, and they dare not discuss their results. This suits Joe fine, and he is eventually brought to a (fictional) U.S. university where he works on a military-sponsored artificial intellegence project. Through Joe's subtle manipulation of the team's feelings and prejudices, he allows pychologists, computer scientists, engineers, etc. to work in harmony to create ""Bossy."" They then feed all human knowledge into her and discover that through Bossy-directed therapy, people are ""reborn"" - physically fit, stripped of prejudice, and with their inate telepathic ability activated.Much of this territory has been re-covered since this novel has been published (just watch a few episodes of Star Trek!), and it's often covered better. But I still enjoyed this prototypical study of the human brain proceeding (aided by Bossy) through its next step of evolution. Clifton and Riley are unforgiving in their depiction of modern man - we are all prejudiced, only about different things. We can be stampeded by effective propeganda to do obviously foolish things. We would ""rather be right"" in our own convictions than be shown a better way, even to the detriment of our health, prosperity, etc.On the surface, the closest analogy I can think of is the Simpson's episode ""Lisa the Skeptic"", wherein a skeleton that looks like an angel is found and the townspeople go on an anti-science riot. A thoughtful reader will perhaps be able to look past the preaching and appreciate the message the authors are trying to convey: No one has a monopoly on the Truth, so don't be afraid to question your assumptions."

B000L6Q9ZS,The Stranger,,A2DNS4YWE6ZT4S,Joseph B. Arnoldin,2/31,1.0,1072310400,Do you really like existentialist atheism and loss of hope?,"This book brought me a chilling and troubling nightmare of what it means to live without hope, which according to Camus, is a positive expression of the freedom of pushing a mute rock up a hill forever in joy as he explicates in his discursive book, The Myth of Sisyphus. But when a spiritual and religious person reads this 'fiction', she will recognize the truth that Camus' work never ceases to entrap itself in death-glorification, even, as in the final paragraph of this book, the stranger finds himself 'as having been happy and happy still', at the thought of the advent of his death, taking joy in the expectation (which, ironically, is a betrayal of Camus' conception of loss of hope as being a positive thing) of the spectacle of his death of execution and the jeers of the mob of spectators as they see him killed. The 'protagonist' of The Stranger is a cold-hearted emotionless character, and throughout this whole book of 'fiction' he turns the stomach. Read it only if you want to be that spectator of a man who willfully denies having hope, faith, and love, making a spectacle of himself for all to see, in that old literary post-modern fashion. I didnt have any kind of guidance when i first read it, someone to tell me that to read Camus was a taking part in the spectacle of a hopeless death, which again, is a good thing for him. He make take joy in hopelessness and the loss of God...Oh its such a twisted vision, one thinks. What freedom it is to rebel against freedom! How free must i be!!!! So, in all seriousness, perhaps one could read it to be more informed about hopeless and selfishly joyful atheism, but only to use your criticism available and valuable to others who are truly inquiring into what life is and what it is worth, to expose the unfortunate cowardliness of Camus, The Stranger."

The whole concept of writing a book about a faceless man just doesn't appeal to me. I know that all of Camus books are strange but this one just wasn't one of his better books. The book just didn't have enough going on in it. The entire book was about the faceless man killing someone and then getting executed. I think the book probably would hae been more interesting if maybe the man fell in love before the execution. It also would have been better if at the end of the book, he actually wrote about the execution instead of just letting us hang, not knowing about what happens at his executon. The exection probably would have made the book alot more exciting too. So if I were you I probably wouldn't read the book unless you are into really wierd, boring books."

I wish that other raters/reviewers would PAY ATTENTION to the difference between providing ratings for the book as opposed to the seller. This book should always be viewed as a classic and a five star or at least 4 star. I read this book some years back but this tale of absurdity and murder and detatchment/alienation of the main character delivers some stimulating reading. Ambiguity makes this book what it is. I found this to be my favorite Camus novel and that is saying alot because his books are typically pretty good. So I won't give away too much but I will remind people to be aware of what you are rating because this book deserves a little respect beyond 2 ratings of one stars it was given."
1401054811,Blind Reason,26.99,A2MOGLXFXLA1FK,"William C. Hammel, PhD",3/3,5.0,1032652800,Blind Reason - All Systems Go,"Blind Reason (BR) is a great read; no doubt about it. But, I think the author is holding out on us. This is supposedly a first novel! One of the great difficulties of any medium is the control of large forms; that rarely comes easily. The magnificent poet is not necessarily a great novelist. A great novel, though it be written with poetic prose, is not necessarily written by a great poet: BR is just what it needs to be. If, indeed, BR is a first novel, the talent for novels springs as Aphrodite, full grown from the mind of Zeus.The sense of time in architecture is wonderful; when something happens is as important as what happens. All things have there just temporal proportion: nothing is too early, and nothing is too late. This sens eof timeing maybe be the most illusive of all artistic parameters.The particular level of realism is one that could only be acheived now. We live in very scary times, and I don't mean alleged Islamic terrorists. I mean the US government, which has become a clear and present danger to all life on this planet; that, and the corporate structures to which it is completely beholden. Any intelligent reader should be able to see that within this enraging story there is as much truth as poetry. That said, the novel wears its cerebral mantle lightly. In fact, it wears all its mantles lightly, and that is exactly one of its greatest charms. Structure that calls attention to itself is defficient in art, and BR does none of that.I certainly did not skim through this book, but read rather deliberately and slowly, simply because I liked the language and details. Some uses of language invite racing through, because the words don't really matter; other uses invite lapping up the the words and savoring them. Blind Reason invites the latter.There is a reduction of material to the essential, so that at no point where some development is needed is there a feeling of inessentialness, i.e., all words count. The additions to the basic English prose of German, Italian and French is fun itself. Griffon doesn't talk down to readers, nor does she talk up. It's that kind of intricate balance that pervades the novel, multiply. Along with the balances are always the tensions: simply put, you awalys want to know what happens next - and speaking of that, somehow, the author speaks, in a not quite omniscient narrator's mask, sympathetically of all characters - even the arch villain. The character of Moriarty in A.C. Doyle comes to mind. There is a decided respect for the power of evil, as in reality there should be. There may be a message here, but first, BR is a novel; the rest is for you to figure out.I simply get get over the ""first novel"" bit, since Blind Reason deftly avoids all the pitfalls of going to large structures before being ready. In one way or another, the author was clearly ready, down to no overworked words, and a nice variation in sentence length. She hasn't fallen victim to a given style, but rather creates a lean one, devoid of self indulgence, in her own voice.Overall, the structural things that I like most are the senses of timing, balance, and balance of tensions. On the entertainment level, it's a wonderful romp and great fun; under that is an expose' of several of the great sicknesses of what for some reason is often referred to as post modern civilization. What's next? ""post post modern""?Personally, as a kind of icing on the cake, I happen to like the detailed attention to food. I was waiting for *the* great recipe for Fettucini Alfredo - fortunately, I already know it :-) Anybody who uses a chiffonade d'herbes with lamb, and actually knows what it means! - get *my* vote. :-) Blind Reason is a well constructed novel, with many kinds of interests, poetry and truth. It is entertaining, thoughtful and informative; Griffon clearly did her homework on pharmaceuticals. Brava! Encore!"
1401054811,Blind Reason,26.99,,,2/2,5.0,1054425600,Move Over John Grisham,"Nobody prepared me for what I would find between the covers of this fantastic book. I had just finished reading King ofTorts when somone suggested Blind Reason, which made Grisham's tale of pharmaceutical corruption look like a comic book. Griffon's attention to detail is astounding; her research into the Third Reich, the Cia and the pharmaceutical industry is meticulous. The plot is fast-paced and the dialogue, on a host of subjects, is brilliant, but I was left with the haunting question of how much of what Griffon wrote is fact or fiction. The lines are definitely blurred. This is a great weekend read. Now, how can I get a date with the heroine, MayaWarwick?"
1401054811,Blind Reason,26.99,A2B8RMK8VJ8Z1I,Rick Giombetti,1/1,5.0,1039824000,Bonfire of the SSRIs,"The Bonfire of the SSRIs or Big Pharma Under FireTwo contemporary authors have addressed the issues of the wealth and power Big Pharma wields in novel-length fiction - grandmaster John LeCarre in THE CONSTANT GARDENER and Patricia Griffon in BLIND REASON. I've read both. LeCarre is, as ever, admirable, but he himself commented, concerning TCG, that his novel is ""tame as a holiday postcard"". After comparison to Griffon's BLIND REASON, I absolutely agree. Reading BLIND REASON is like a series of fascinating and sometimes terrifying rides in a top-of-the-line amusement park. Sometimes it feels like a survival training course. When you disembark, both shaken and stirred, you will recognize the real-world players that the characters in BLIND REASON resemble. The masks are off.... Griffon's scope and international intrigue are wider than LeCarre's, and her characters and events arrive and explode with the speed of fireworks. LeCarre has steered clear of the dangers of talking back to Prozac by centering his issues around a fictitious TB drug tested on an unsuspecting African tribe and the diplomatic service - sets and settings both rather difficult for the contemporary reader to identify with. There may be very good reasons for this: as he recorded, a real activist in Nairobi ended up with a bullet wound in his head, and this sort of accident ""can happen again"". The more courageous writer, Griffon, has personal knowledge of and has researched the Prozac family of drugs and their cousins, and has presented a possible future and it is nasty. The Nazis, resurrected with hidden fortunes from WWII, have a plan for us - and in their hands, and on everyone's lips, will be drugs.... BLIND REASON is one of the few books I have read that I will return to all my life. My copy will need to be replaced in a few months. I am guilty of book-bashing and reference-writing and article-stuffing again - it's the darndest book I've ever read. Why? Griffon's purpose in writing the book - to expose the dangers of Pharma/political connections and corruption - fills in the stories between the lines in today's news reports. Why did the US government vote through a bill that protects *both* Homeland and Eli Lilly from prosecution re Thiomersol (vaccines linked to autism cases)? Because of Patricia Griffon's politically astute BLIND REASON, I think I know the *reason*. I might keep THE CONSTANT GARDENER in my guest bedroom - as a soporific - but poring over BLIND REASON has kept me awake many nights. Want a gentle mare or a sleeping pill, the predictable clockwork themes of Bach? Try LeCarre. For the ride of your life, get Griffon. BLIND REASON rocks - and may rock your world. This is Griffon's first turn as a suspense writer. I believe she will outshine Antonia Fraser, Patricia Cornwell and LeCarre (once again) in her next book, BLIND CHANCE. Break out the champagne - the belle of the ball is here! BLIND REASON is an entry in the 2003 Pulitzer Prize competition.Also recommended: The Constant Gardener by John LeCarre"

1401054811,Blind Reason,26.99,A2B8RMK8VJ8Z1I,Rick Giombetti,0/1,4.0,1040083200,Paxil withdrawal suit plaintiff turns novelist,"Blind Reason is the first novel published by Paxil withdrawal suit plaintiff Patricia Griffon. The novel was written during a period of time in the late '90s when the author says she was going through a difficult withdrawal from taking the popular anti-anxiety/depressant drug Paxil. Blind Reason imagines a diabolical plot to reestablish the Third Reich as a political force in the Western world using a German-based pharmaceutical company's marketing of a new Prozac-like ""mood brightner"" Euphorin. Euphorin is to Blind Reason what Soma is to Brave New World, a drug used to help the masses forget their cares, and any notions of a living in a democratic and free society as well.Blind Reason's heroine is Maya Warwick, a reclusive investigative journalist and writer who lives in a mountain community west of Denver and suspects there is more to the marketing campaign behind Euphorin than helping heal the emotional suffering of the masses. Maya has broken other stories about the marketing of psychiatric drugs before and her motives for her journalism are more than just informing the public. Her motives are personal. Both her parents had been the victims of a murder-suicide while one of them was under the influence of a older psychiatric drug implicated in dozens of other grisly acts of violence. Meanwhile, a close friend has recently committed suicide while taking Euphorin. Like countless thousands of other family and friends of people who committed destructive acts of violence while under the influence of psychiatric drugs, Maya simply wants to know what role the drugs might be playing the grisly murder-suicides that are likely to dominate the evening news these days.Blind Reason works best when it sticks to the story behind the diabolical conspiracy to foment a neo-Nazi uprising in Colorado and beyond. The intrigue behind the German-based pharmaceutical giant VB Pharmaceuticals and its American-based subsidiary FetcherBurkeWinslow is what held my attention the most. Maya finds herself recruited, basically against her will, into an CIA mission to uncover the links between VB-FBW and the burgeoning neo-Nazi movement in the U.S. This is interesting material that is fun to read. Furthermore, the author inserts mention of the influence the resistance to the aggressive marketing of psychiatric drug has had on her research into her writing here. In this sense, Blind Reason is more than just another spy novel, but a literature of this resistance to the conventional wisdom of the Prozac-era, which holds that everybody has lived happily ever after since the introduction of Prozac to the market in December 1987.Far too many words are devoted to a love triangle involving one of Maya's neighbors and an agent she meets before flying off to Germany. Both of Maya's love interests here are the kind of middle-aged male characters who make my eyes roll over. First, there's Blubbering Andrew, Maya's next door neighbor, and Handsome Agent Harry, the agent who trains our heroine in a crash course of German and waltzing. Does Maya throw herself into the arms of our dashing agent before she flies off to Germany? Does our dashing Agent Harry mindlessly abandon his job and run off to Europe to track down his new found love Maya? Does Andrew blubber over the phone about how he's missed out on his last chance to find love with Maya over the phone? Is Maya's decision on who she will ultimately take for a lover in the end conveniently provided for her by way of being seated next to her future amour on her plane ride back to Colorado? Does the sky have stars on a clear night?After over 550 pages, Blind Reason pants and wheezes and hurls itself exhausted across the finish line. In the end the reader is subjected to a confessional group therapy session we've all seen over and over again on Oprah and all the other talk shows. No wait. Harry tells Maya, ""Being with you is as close as I've come in years to feeling any human connection, or emotion. I thought that part of me was dead forever, especially after Annabella died. Thanks to you, I see now that I could feel those things again, and that's the most hope I've had in years."" I hadn't heard that before.Blind Reason is a worthy first effort for Griffon. It is a work of fiction that could have only been concocted in the mind of a person under the influence of a potent and aggressively marketed pharmacueutical drug. I found that it dragged on a little too long and the little love triangle our heroine finds herself in is little too much Harlequinn romance for me.Rick's Scientfically certain rating: 8 on a scale of 1 to 10.-Rick Giombetti, Seattle ..."

The author is a devoted Serbophile mixing historical half-truths and half-fictions always to the elevation of the Serbs among other balkan nations. The result is that nothing in this book can be trusted for any historical value and in the long term it backfires on many fronts as history has recently proven. In the end this book can only bee seen as an exposition of the views and ideas of the author herself rather then the people that she's describing. As a conclusion this book doesn't serve anybody's purpose as a historical/travel account book, but would certainly be much better suited to the 'Fiction' section of the library where it would be appreciated for what it is, a fiction/propaganda book."
0862414288,Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics),,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,Jeffrey Leach,134/139,5.0,1004054400,Wonderful,"Love it or hate it, anyone with an interest in the Balkans will eventually have to deal with this book. Rebecca West is one of the giants of 20th century literature. Never heard of her? I hadn't either until I read this sprawling opus. Don't be put off by the size of the book, however (West herself writes that most people probably won't read this book because of the massive length). Black Lamb and Grey Falcon is a travelogue detailing West's travels through 1930's Yugoslavia. The book goes far beyond travelogue as West intersperses massive doses of Slavic history and philosophy with her travel accounts. Not only do we see the things she sees, we understand the mentality of the people. These people she meets and places she visits become almost mystical under her magical pen. I read this book over a six week period at the end of the summer. Like West on her travels, I meandered through the book, reading it religiously at times and then setting it down for a bit to read other things. This might be the best way to read the book. It allows the reader to absorb what West is trying to say without being overwhelmed by the immense amounts of information.I have to say that I was most fascinated by her discourses on Yugoslav history. Balkan history can be a challenge because most of us in the West really don't understand the people or places involved. A section on the assassination of Franz Ferdinand runs on forever and never becomes boring. In fact, I became so enraptured of this event that I started reading other works concerning the assassination. Even though there are some problems with West's interpretation of history, her accounts are so well written that it makes the reader want to go out and read more about these events.Many have criticized Rebecca West for her bias and her tendency to simplify history. This is a valid concern. Her most serious transgression is her rabid hatred of anything German. It literally infects parts of the book with a somber, unpleasant tone. Right from the beginning of the book we see West criticizing a group of German tourists who are on a train with her as she travels into the Balkans. The bias finds greatest expression when West writes about her relationship with her Yugoslav guide Constantine and his wife Gerda. Constantine is a Jew and a Slav, but Gerda is a German whom West seems to believe is a Nazi. West's slanders on Gerda are endless, so much so that Constantine himself eventually turns against West. What is important to remember is that West is English and World War II was only a few years away. West actually wrote this book a few years after her trip, in 1941, so war was already raging between the two countries. If I were a German, I would be offended by West's comments.Please read this book. I guarantee you'll enjoy it, at least to some extent. Even if you don't like history, the descriptions of the Yugoslav people and places are enchanting. I wanted to hop on a plane and go to Yugoslavia after reading this book, although it's important to remember that this account was written during World War II and before the Communist occupation that followed the war. I imagine things have changed quite a bit in this part of the world since the 1930's. What prose! What endless beauty! Images that flow like honey! Read this and dream!!"

La Rue ""Marc L LeRoux""",79/80,5.0,1126742400,"Been there, done that, then read BLGF","I read BLGF after returning to the US after living in the region for over two years. I found and read Robert Kaplan's ""Balkan Ghosts,"" while the 1999 NATO action in Kosovo within clear sight of the situation. Kaplan made numerous positive referrences to BLGF so I found and read that soon after returning to the US. (I do know that Clinton did read BG (and that this led him to intervene in Bosnia-Herzegovina) and so may have read BLGF after leaving office). I suppose it was because of my very personal witness to the Balkans when I was living there, in particular the personal stories and lives that were generously offered by loving and almost pathetically nationalistic people. I found that RW, regardless of her ""only six week"" tour of Yugoslavia hit the button on the head in an overwhelming fashion. The personal emotional bias must be understood and the historical meat filtered through it. I didn't find that any history she related was false. What did startle me was how much similar her findings were to my own, fifty years later. When one understands that Tito effectively froze the populations of Yugoslavia in time through the use of forced migrations and a strong secret police force, how this could be becomes easy to grasp. But Rebecca West's journalistic intellect reaches its zenith when after witnessing the ritual slaughter of lambs, makes one of the best arguments against religion I have ever read. At once, she makes the best intellectual and emotional argument I can never have imagined as I read the brilliance of it. How a people come to act as both lambs and falcons, victims of history, myth and legend. The story of the Serbian people and for that matter the Balkans is something not to be missed by anyone interested in the story of civilization.I lived in Slovenia in the late 1990s for over two years, serving the public in concert with a Slovenian orthopedic surgeon. I was married there in 1999 before returning to the US. As one deeply drawn to historic studies since childhood, I carried along with me, a small library of historic works on European history, including the very large History of the Habsburg Empire, published by the Berkeley University Press. I traveled to many regions, but more importanly, had (and still retain) friends who are Slovene, Serb, Bosnian Serb as well as acquaintances of some in higher government and military offices. At one point, I was even invited to an informal meeting of (Ljublijana) university professors and a Croatian UN Bosnia-Herzegovina Peacekeeper mission executive. I was present to witness the development of the problems in Kosovo and led to the Bombing Campaign in 1999. I saw the protests against it that took place in front of the US Embassy in Ljublijana as I went there for the settling of various matters so I could be married in Slovenia legally. My dear, loving Serbian receptionist was symbolically blocking the entrance with other protestors. And later that day we met at the office and worked with only the slightest bit of simmering resentment, so deep was our care for one another. Through her, I learned so much, and on a later return, attended a Serbian Orthodox service as her guest, just to get a deeper feeling of the history of these people. It was very moving. People torn between the most generous loving inclinations with a rare love of life and at the same time, mutilated by a long history of oppression. They see themselves alone with the world against them. This same friend was also in the crowd in Belgrade that finally brought down Milosevic. All attempts to understand and find the tortured human element in Serbs is an obligation for us. And doing so does not require that we denigrate or minimalize the Albanians or any other of the ethnic groups in the Balkans. BLGF so enriched by complement, all these experiences. When I return, I do so with a greater and greater depth of knowledge and tolerance for all, regardless of the minefields of strong nationalistic sentiments one must step through to do so.What makes BLGF so great and a must read for anyone remotely interested in history or literature in general is that it is at once an excellent source of introductory history of a region that has been for the West, lost in a mist of vagarities and myth. At the same time related as a personal experience by RW in a almost lyric fashion. Go with it, even the angry diatribes about men. History becomes real when it is felt as a personal experience; That is why traveling and living abroad is so valuable for everyone, but especially for Americans, who need to understand the world that their government so often effects. If there is anyplace in the world that can teach us that nothing is simple and perhaps most important, impress the American reader with the eternal sense of history, expanding that compression of time that US history lives in, the Balkans are it. This is a book that ought to be used at least at the community college class level in both literature and history classes.I have read many of the reviews and various opinions on this book, including the one critic living in the region who only allowed one star. (Locals hate outsiders having any opinion of them). My view is that all the praises and criticisms are valid and deserved, even the one that questions whether RW and her husband had any kind of sexual realtionship and if her husband might have actually been homosexual. Without doubt, RW was a strong willed individual and I gathered from her occassional diatribes concerning men that she had a issue with the entire gender and completely capable of a ""marriage of convenience."" (So what)? Realizing that her father had left her mother and then soon died, must be somewhat to blame. Allow her to be human, it made her what she was as a writer. So although I found her rants less than usefull, I allowed her to be human because this book is part journal, part essay and part diary. How many authors have laid their own feelings out so clearly. Given the period that it was published in, that took courage. I have to wonder with our emotionally suppressive PC enviroment today, how could anyone even conceive such writing today and not be shouted down by the ""thought police"" installed in their own mind? Welcome to journalism before PC! What a gift that is in itself - an artifact of true intellectual freedom."
0862414288,Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics),,ATEWBAUWS9N3S,Stephen B. Selbst,60/62,5.0,1094515200,A Dense But Rewarding Masterpiece,"In Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, Rebecca West weaves together history, ethnography and travelogue into an encyclopedic and unforgettable portrait of this troubled region. As I explain below, I think there are some marvelous things about this book, and some aspects that are less well realized. On balance, it is well worth the effort, but for somebody considering it, the cautions are worth noting. First the highlights:West is at her best as a reporter. She has a truly brilliant eye for detail, for simply seeing how the people lived, what they wore, how they worshipped and what they did with their days. Her images, particularly of the remote communities and the many churches and religious shrines that she visited, are particularly well rendered. Although the book lacks photographs or drawings, West's very considerable talents for description are such that the reader really gets a feel for a large number of diverse places within the Balkans.She also does an excellent job illuminating a great deal of the history of the region, both relatively modern history (meaning modern at the time the book was written -- 1941) and more ancient history. Modern history at the time West wrote meant dealing with the Balkan wars, the series of rebellions by which the vestiges of the Ottoman empire were overthrown in the 19th and early 20th centuries. West devotes particular attention to the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo in June 1914, which precipitated World War I, an event that at the time of the writing of the book was still relatively recent in the world's memory, and the facts of which were still somewhat controversial. Ancient history meant dealing with the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, the decisive battle in which the Turks defeated the Orthodox Serbs led by Tsar Lazar and began to move further north and east in Europe.West's writing on why liberal democracies are typically reluctant to arm themselves to confront militant totalitarian regimes, which forms a secondary theme, seems quite fresh. West writes as an unabashed liberal and closely analyzes both her own squeamishness about violence and why, in more general terms, liberals' reluctance to use force is ultimately suicidal. Her criticism of the pacifism of the governments of pre-World War II England and France in the face of the visible threat of a rearming Germany and a bellicose Italy is both fascinating and dead-on. One of the points she makes in her admiration of the Slavs is that for five centuries, beginning with the Battle of of Kosovo, and largely ignored by Western Europe, they took arms against the totalitarian regime of their day, militant Islam in the form of the Ottoman empire. Her point of view on this issue is quite clear: for taking on this task, she regards the Serbs to have been the unrecognized and unthanked saviors of Western Christianity.As brilliant as this book is, however, it will not be to every reader's taste, even those who want to explore the history of the Balkans in depth. West makes little effort to disguise her prejudices: she sees the Slavs as an heroic if primitive race who had been ill-used by the then Great Powers of Europe, Great Britian, France, Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. And within what was then the newly-formed state of Yugoslavia (which came into being after World War I), she is emphatic in her sympathies for the Serbs, whom she sees as the the descendants of what was good and right in the Byzantine empire. West is equally obvious in her lack of sympathy for the Croats and the Bosnians. But seen through the lens of the more recent wars of Serbian aggression, it is harder to see the Serbs in such an unqualifiedly heroic light.Other parts of the books also wear less well, including her prolixity (the paperback edition is a whopping 1150 pages of small print). West's long tirades on the evils of the Austro-Hungarian empire seem a curiosity at this point; as evil as it may have been, it has long been relegated to the dustbin of history. Her antipathy to the Germans also seems an historical set piece, although rather more understandable in its context. And West's economic analyses of modern capitalism appear naive and superficial. Finally, the relatively major roles played in her narrative by she and her husband, their Serbian guide Constantine, and his German wife Gerda, are, at best, distracting. But these reservations should be seen for what they are: minor criticisms of an awe-inspiring work."
0862414288,Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics),,,,32/33,5.0,937440000,"Today's enemy, tomorrow's friend...","...I initially was not so moved to write this review of Ms. West's remarkable work. What has inspired in me the need, though, was the reading of her being persistently condemned for her sympathy for the poor beleagured Serbians. Indeed...moreso than anything else, her work has forced me to ponder the question of 'What shall we tomorrow say of the 'poor, exploited, tormented Kosovars'?' It is most ironic that Ms. West's six-week journey through Yugoslavia should have so accurately succeeded in capturing the spirit of the land. Read it not for a travel guide, but as a snapshot of the past...nowhere else do we have access to many of the prodigious quantity of sources which she employed in her authoring...and whereelse may we hope to find a British tourist's view of the Balkans upon the eve of war? Nowhere. It is unique...and incomparable...and her revelations are sometimes stunning, her prose frequently beauteous...thus, five stars."
0862414288,Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics),,APQQR9NI511PB,Alekos,45/49,5.0,944352000,Pure pleasure,"One has to stand in awe before this enormous (ll40 pages) masterpiece of literary travel writing, even with its prejudice and poetry and occasional unkindness. Ms West and her husband and Constantine (he of the stubby fingers and wicked keyboard technique who tells unbelievable stories and opines on every imaginable topic) travel through Yugoslavia at the time Hitler is gaining power in Germany and the Habsburg Empire is just a dirty memory. Constantine is a Serb utterly devoted to the continued existence of the Yugoslav state but he's married to a dreadful hausfrau who despises anything that is not German and especially Slavs. She thus makes her own life miserable and does a number on the lives of everyone else. The book offers rich descriptions of all the states that make up (or made up)Yugoslavia, including religious and social customs, the mental and emotional tendencies of the people (sometimes depending on which outside influences -- Turkish, Austrian -- have impacted them most decisively). Montenegran men come in for high praise because because of their physical beauty and the presumed ease with which they could inseminate any woman. The book is a masterwork of richly textured Enlgish prose done in long, elegant, sometimes convoluted sentence that are a delight to read and may remind some readers of Proust. St. Paul and St. Augustine come in for the mistreatment they so richly deserve (the author traces several questionable religious practices she encounters to ideas found in their writings). This is a work for reasonably well educated adults, so anyone approaching it in search of accurate factual history is making a mistake. But nor will it mislead anyone on matters of historical fact."
