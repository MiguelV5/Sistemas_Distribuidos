B00007FY9S,"Perl 5 Pocket Reference, 3rd Edition: Programming Tools (O'Reilly Perl)",,A1IYM4MSLDVV8R,A Customer,6/8,2.0,931910400,Sometimes helpful but incomplete,"As the other reviewers mention, the book is poorly organized and lacks an index. Additionally, it is cavalierly incomplete in places. For example, the definition given for &quot;\n, \r, \f, \t, etc.&quot; is &quot;have their usual meaning&quot; (p. 21)."
0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,,A30TK6U7DNS82R,Kevin Killian,10/10,5.0,1095724800,Really Enjoyed It,"I don't care much for Dr. Seuss but after reading Philip Nel's book I changed my mind--that's a good testimonial to the power of Rel's writing and thinking. Rel plays Dr. Seuss the ultimate compliment of treating him as a serious poet as well as one of the 20th century's most interesting visual artists, and after reading his book I decided that a trip to the Mandeville Collections of the library at University of California in San Diego was in order, so I could visit some of the incredible Seuss/Geisel holdings they have there.There's almost too much to take in, for, like William Butler Yeats, Seuss led a career that constantly shifted and metamoprhized itself to meet new historical and political cirsumstances, so he seems to have been both a leftist and a conservative at different junctures of his career, both in politics and in art. As Nel shows us, he was once a cartoonist for the fabled PM magazine and, like Andy Warhol, he served his time slaving in the ad business too. All was in the service of amusing and broadening the minds of US children. Nel doesn't hesitate to administer a sound spanking to the Seuss industry that, since his death, has seen fit to license all kinds of awful products including the recent CAT IN THE HAT film with Mike Myers. Oh, what a cat-astrophe!The book is great and I can especially recommend the work of the picture editor who has given us a bounty of good illustrations."

1556227868,From My Mother's Hands: Remembrances and Recipes from Texas Women,21.95,A9K8UY85P0IVX,Lloyd R. Mardis,1/1,5.0,1070755200,Not a Daughter--Darn it!,"Looking through this book, I realized that I might have achieved more in this life if I had been a daughter. The supporting relationships between daughters and mothers, so well detailed in this book by Susie Kelly Flatau, would make any guy a bit envious. Don't get me wrong--fathers are O.K. And, being a son to a mother is fine too, but reading this book it brought home to me that I could neither fully appreciate nor appropriate that special relationship enjoyed by a daughter and her mother."

The enchanting tributes to their mothers by 33 prominent Texas women will entice readers to embark on their own reflective journey home to their mothers' arms."
B000GLWNPI,"Jekyll, Alias Hyde",,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""",2/2,4.0,951696000,Make Up Your Own Mind,"This book is written assuming the reader has already read Robert Louis Stevenson's _The Strange Case of Doctor Jeckyll and Mister Hyde,_ one of the classics of horror/science fiction. It's an interesting companion volume in which the author picks apart Stevenson's assertion that the two men, Jeckyll and Hyde, are the same individual. Every reader has to make up their own mind whether they buy the argument, but it's incontrovertable that Donald Thomas makes a good case."
B000KPCR8I,The Forever Machine,,,,11/14,2.0,925516800,Disapointed,"Book #2 in my read through the Hugo's. While I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;The Demolished Man&quot; by Alfred Bester, this novel comes across as being way too preachy. Seeking a telepathic companion, Joe Carter orchastrates the building of the first super-computer, named Bossy, that has the ability to renew mankind. Wash away their prejudices and preconcieved notions. And, I guess in the view of the authors, create a race of zombies with no convictions. Skip this one if you're looking for classic Sci-Fi."
B000KPCR8I,The Forever Machine,,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,Craig MACKINNON,1/1,4.0,1236124800,"A universal study of the human mind, unfortunately with some laughable science","As one of the earliest Hugo winners, I was willing to approach this book with an open mind - much of the speculative and scientific fiction of the '50s looks naive or simply contains erroneous science. This book contains such problems in spades. The idea that all human disease can be washed away through psychotherapy is laughable, and some of the other science is equally quaint. I'd even go so far as to say that the authors should have known better, even in the '50s, or that they misunderstood (perhaps delibrately) some of the basic laws of science. Fortunately, the science is really just the medium through which the story can be told. The real theme of this book is the nature of humanity. I'm afraid the authors have a very unflattering opinion of human nature!The story: Little ""Crazy Joe"" Carter is a telepath - an honest-to-goodness mind-reader. Unfortunately, since there is no scientific theory that can support the notion of telepathy, and in the highly politicized scientific commnuity of this future world, his abilities are dismissed the evidence ignored. Only a few free-thinkers accept the evidence, and they dare not discuss their results. This suits Joe fine, and he is eventually brought to a (fictional) U.S. university where he works on a military-sponsored artificial intellegence project. Through Joe's subtle manipulation of the team's feelings and prejudices, he allows pychologists, computer scientists, engineers, etc. to work in harmony to create ""Bossy."" They then feed all human knowledge into her and discover that through Bossy-directed therapy, people are ""reborn"" - physically fit, stripped of prejudice, and with their inate telepathic ability activated.Much of this territory has been re-covered since this novel has been published (just watch a few episodes of Star Trek!), and it's often covered better. But I still enjoyed this prototypical study of the human brain proceeding (aided by Bossy) through its next step of evolution. Clifton and Riley are unforgiving in their depiction of modern man - we are all prejudiced, only about different things. We can be stampeded by effective propeganda to do obviously foolish things. We would ""rather be right"" in our own convictions than be shown a better way, even to the detriment of our health, prosperity, etc.On the surface, the closest analogy I can think of is the Simpson's episode ""Lisa the Skeptic"", wherein a skeleton that looks like an angel is found and the townspeople go on an anti-science riot. A thoughtful reader will perhaps be able to look past the preaching and appreciate the message the authors are trying to convey: No one has a monopoly on the Truth, so don't be afraid to question your assumptions."
