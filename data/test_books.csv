The Fools in Town Are on Our Side,"""Hain't we got all the fools in town on our side? And ain't that a big enough majority in any town?"" -- Mark Twain Ross Thomas chose the quotation from Huckleberry Finn as the text of his post World War II story as well as for the title. When Lucifer Dye is released from three months in a Hong Kong prison, debriefed, handed a false passport, a new wardrobe and a $20,000 check, his haughty control makes it clear that Dye's career with his country has been permanently terminated. But a good agent is always in demand, and just a few hours later Dye is being interviewed for a highly ingenious position. Victor Orcutt, although a not very good imitation of a British pre-war gent, has creative talents of his own. He has his sights a small southern city, with the ordinary run-of-the-mill corruption one would expect in such a place. The canny Orcott knows there's no profit in that . His creed is ""To get better, it must be much worse."" He and his two associates have looked up Dye's history, and he now offers the ex-spy's a mission. For two and a half times the government's bounty, Dye is to thoroughly corrupt the town. And the sly Dye takes the offer.",['Ross Thomas'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zMWEVj-Kv0cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=zMWEVj-Kv0cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Fools+in+Town+Are+on+Our+Side&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Minotaur Books,2007-04-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zMWEVj-Kv0cC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],2.0
Eyes,"Pindar's Eyes is a ground-breaking interdisciplinary exploration of the interactions between Greek lyric poetry and visual and material culture in the early fifth century BCE. It draws on case studies of classical art and texts to open up analysis of the genre to the wider theme of aestheticexperience in early classical Greece, with particular focus on the poetic mechanisms through which Pindar's victory odes use visual and material culture to engage their audiences. Complete readings of Nemean 5, Nemean 8, and Pythian 1 reveal the poet's deep interest in the relations between lyricpoetry and commemorative and religious sculpture, as well as other significant visual phenomena, while literary studies of his evocation of cultural attitudes through elaborate use of the lyric first person are combined with art-historical treatments of ecphrasis, of image and text, and of art'sframing of ritual experience in ancient Greece. This specific aesthetic approach is expanded through fresh treatments of Simonides' and Bacchylides' own engagements with material culture, as well as an account of Pindaric themes in the Aeginetan logoi of Herodotus' Histories. These come together tooffer not just a novel perspective on the relationship between art and text in Pindaric poetry, but to give rise to new claims about the nature of classical Greek visuality and ritual subjectivity, and to foster a richer understanding of the ways in which classical poetry and art shaped the livesand experiences of its ancient consumers.",['David Fearn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0n8yDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0n8yDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA271&dq=Eyes&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,2017-09-21,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0n8yDwAAQBAJ&dq=Eyes&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Collections'],
Teaching Stories,"When nearly everyone else is telling kids no—""No, do it this way….No, I don’t want to hear what you think….No, sit down and pay attention""—Judy Logan says yes, to a child’s passions, interests, and hopes. The results have been news-making; her students blossom academically, winning essay contests, prizes, and entrance to the country’s best colleges. Armed with a strong sense of who they are and what they think, her students also blossom personally—resisting peer pressure, understanding racial and gender stereotypes, and connecting to the world in which they live. Drawing on over thirty years ""knee deep in adolescence"" as a teacher in a public middle school, Judy Logan shows that it is the very vulnerability of adolescence that makes it a time of tremendous opportunity for emotional, intellectual, and social growth. Uniting creativity and compassion, Logan’s vivid classroom stories bring into focus for all parents numerous effective strategies for working with adolescents. Above all, Judy Logan is a compelling storyteller who loves and respects her students and the work of learning. Eye-opening and inspirational, the stories she has to tell take the simple human drama of day-to-day classroom life and create an all-embracing vision of the possibilities of public education in America.",['Judy Logan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lF4qDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lF4qDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT148&dq=Teaching+Stories&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Kodansha USA,2010-08-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lF4qDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Education'],1.0

The making of Europe: An introduction to the history of European unity,"Christopher Dawson concludes that the period of the fourth to the eleventh centuries, commonly known as the Dark Ages, is not a barren prelude to the creative energy of the medieval world. Instead, he argues that it is better described as ""ages of dawn"" for it is in this rich and confused period that the complex and creative interaction of the Roman empire, the Christian Church, the classical tradition, and barbarous societies provided the foundation for a vital, unified European culture. In an age of fragmentation and the emergence of new nationalist forces, Dawson argued that if ""our civilization is to survive, it is essential that it should develop a common European consciousness and sense of historic and organic unity."" But he was clear that this unity required sources deeper and more complex than the political and economic movements on which so many had come to depend, and he insisted, prophetically, that Europe would need to recover its Christian roots if it was to survive. In a time of cultural and political ambiguity, The making of Europe is an indispensable work for understanding not only the rich sources but also the contemporary implications of the very idea of Europe.",['Christopher Dawson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a99zdvANyGkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=a99zdvANyGkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+making+of+Europe:+An+introduction+to+the+history+of+European+unity&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,CUA Press,2002,http://books.google.nl/books?id=a99zdvANyGkC&dq=The+making+of+Europe:+An+introduction+to+the+history+of+European+unity&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0

"Anatomy, descriptive and surgical","Gray's Anatomy, published in the UK in 1858 under the original title Anatomy: Descriptive and Surgical, is a detailed English textbook on human anatomy, focused on teaching medical students human anatomy for practical knowledge during surgery. This unique first edition includes more than 300 pages of illustrations by H.V. Carter, M.D. Each image is labeled with the corresponding bones, muscles, nerves, and organs. In addition, the book is separated into chapters based on the systems of the body for easy use. While Gray's Anatomy may no longer be a suitable study guide for modern physicians, it is considered a classic work on the subject and is a great reference for those interested in the origins of the study of human anatomy. HENRY GRAY (1827-1861) was a renowned British anatomist who studied at St George's Hospital Medical School in London. His focus was on the endocrine glands and spleen until he approached fellow colleague Henry Vandyke Carter to help him write a comprehensive and accessible anatomy textbook.

Home Before Dark,"Voor het donker thuis is de nieuwste thriller van Riley Sager, bekend van De laatste meisjes en Mijn laatste leugen. Voor de fans van Netflix' The Haunting of Hill House. Spannend van begin tot eind. Voor het donker thuis is de razend spannende nieuwe thriller van bestsellerauteur Riley Sager, auteur van De laatste meisjes, Mijn laatste leugen en Sluit alle deuren. Hoe was het om in dat huis te wonen? Maggie Holt is die vraag wel gewend. Vijfentwintig jaar geleden verhuisde ze met haar ouders, Ewan en Jess, naar Baneberry Hall, een negentiende-eeuws landhuis in Vermont. Drie weken later waren ze er halsoverkop uit vertrokken; een traumatische gebeurtenis waarover Ewan later een bestseller zou schrijven. Tegenwoordig knapt Maggie oude woningen op en ze kan zich de gebeurtenissen van toen nauwelijks herinneren. Ze gelooft ook eigenlijk geen woord van wat er in haar vaders boek staat. Wanneer ze na zijn dood Baneberry Hall erft, gaat ze terug naar de plek waar het allemaal begon. Ze is van plan om het pand een facelift te geven en te verkopen. Haar terugkeer wordt met argusogen bekeken door de inwoners, want het kleine stadje is er niet goed vanaf gekomen in haar vaders boek. Zodra Maggie over de drempel van Baneberry Hall stapt begint ze zich af te vragen of er toch geen waarheid in het boek schuilt. Van Riley Sagers boeken zijn inmiddels ruim 40.000 exemplaren verkocht in Nederland en België. Voor het donker thuis is de perfecte read voor de fans van Netflix' The Haunting of Hill House. ‘Deze pakkende thriller is een must-read!’ – J.D. Barker ‘Een heerlijk beangstigend boek. Dit moet je lezen wanneer het donker wordt, als de wind huilt en er in de verte een raam klappert. Zorg dat je dicht bij een lichtschakelaar zit. Die zou je weleens nodig kunnen hebben.’ – Ruth Ware ‘Wederom een adembenemende hit van Sager.’ – Booklist ‘King of thrillers Sager is terug met een verhaal over een vrouw die terugkeert naar haar ouderlijk huis; een horrorsetting bij uitstek en goed voor een razendsnelle hartslag en kippenvel.’ – Newsweek ‘Een verslavende thriller.’ – The Washington Post",['Riley Sager'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cdEHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cdEHEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Home+Before+Dark&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Ambo|Anthos,2021-03-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cdEHEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

"First principles,","This volume presents an interconnected set of sixteen essays, four of which are previously unpublished, by Allan Gotthelf—one of the leading experts in the study of Aristotle's biological writings. Gotthelf addresses three main topics across Aristotle's three main biological treatises. Starting with his own ground-breaking study of Aristotle's natural teleology and its illuminating relationship with the Generation of Animals, Gotthelf proceeds to the axiomatic structure of biological explanation (and the first principles such explanation proceeds from) in the Parts of Animals. After an exploration of the implications of these two treatises for our understanding of Aristotle's metaphysics, Gotthelf examines important aspects of the method by which Aristotle organizes his data in the History of Animals to make possible such a systematic, explanatory study of animals, offering a new view of the place of classification in that enterprise. In a concluding section on 'Aristotle as Theoretical Biologist', Gotthelf explores the basis of Charles Darwin's great praise of Aristotle and, in the first printing of a lecture delivered worldwide, provides an overview of Aristotle as a philosophically-oriented scientist, and 'a proper verdict' on his greatness as scientist.",['Allan Gotthelf'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FwNREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FwNREAAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&dq=First+principles,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Oxford University Press,2012-02-23,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FwNREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],

Studying the Torah: A guide to in-depth interpretation,"The traditional Jew has always accepted the study of Torah as central to his or her way of life. But without the ability to effectively analyze and interpret the text, one misses the opportunity to gain a deep and authentic appreciation of the Torah's beauty and profundity. In Studying the Torah: A Guide to In-Depth Interpretation, Avigdor Bonchek equips the reader with the proper analytic methods to make reading the Bible both a serious pursuit and a pleasurable pastime. In order for the reader of the Torah text to delve into its veiled, but ultimately visible, layered messages, he or she must first learn the appropriate interpretive techniques. These skills are the same as those used by the classic Jewish Torah commentators (Rashi, Ramban, Ibn Ezra, and others), all of whom were experts in what scholars today refer to as a ""close reading"" of the text. Among the ""Keys to Interpretation"" discussed in this book are the significance of word order, opening sentences, repetitions, word associations, psychological dimensions, and similarities and differences between texts. Each key is illustrated by several examples that offer fresh insight into otherwise familiar text, and the author offers his own original and comprehensive in-depth interpretation of two central biblical stories: the story of Joseph and the ten plagues.",['Avigdor Bonchek'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XzyXMN7JFYIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XzyXMN7JFYIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Studying+the+Torah:+A+guide+to+in-depth+interpretation&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Jason Aronson, Incorporated",1997-04-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XzyXMN7JFYIC&dq=Studying+the+Torah:+A+guide+to+in-depth+interpretation&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

"Chicago's North Michigan Avenue: Planning and Development, 1900-1930 (Chicago Architecture and Urbanism)","Since its opening in the 1920s, Chicago's North Michigan Avenue has been one of the city's most prestigious commerical corridors, lined by some of its most architecturally distinctive business, residential, and hotel buildings. Planned by Daniel Burnham in 1909, the avenue became the principal connecting link between downtown and the wealthy, residential ""Gold Coast"" north of the Loop. Some thirty buildings were constructed along its path in the ten-year period before the Depression, an urban expansion comparable in significance to that of Pennsylvania and Park Avenues. John W. Stamper traces the complex development of North Michigan Avenue from the 1880s to the 1920s building boom that solidified its character and economic base, describing the initiation of the planning process by private interests to its execution aided by the city's powerful condemnation and taxation proceedings. He focuses on individual buildings constructed on the avenue, including the Renaissance- and Gothic-inspired Wrigley Building, Tribune Tower, and Drake Hotel, and places them within the context of factors governing their construction—property ownership, financing, zoning laws, design theory, and advertising. Stamper compares this stylistically diverse mixture of low- and high-rise structures with earlier, rejected planning proposals, all of which had prescribed a uniformly designed, European-like avenue of continuous cornice heights, consistent facade widths, and complementary stylistic features. He analyzes the drastically different character the avenue took by 1930, with high-rise towers reaching thirty stories and beyond, in terms of the clash among economic, political, and architectural interests. His argument—that the discrepancies between the rejected plans and reality illustrate the developers' choice of economic return on their investment over aesthetic community—is extended through to the present avenue and the virtual disregard of the urban qualities proposed at its inception. Generously illustrated, with an epilogue condensing the avenue's history between the end of World War II and the present, this is an exhaustive account of an important topic in the history of modern architecture and city planning.",['John W.

Even separately, the books achieved a towering presence. Together for the first time as an integrated whole, as they were intended to be, the result is sure to rock the world of economic and political ideas.

Tales of Virtue: A Book of Right and Wrong (The Beginners Bible),"Children's Bibles have been among the most popular and influential types of religious publications in the United States, providing many Americans with their first formative experiences of the Bible and its stories. In Children's Bibles in America, Russell W. Dalton explores the variety of ways in which children's Bibles have adapted, illustrated, and retold Bible stories for children throughout U.S. history. This reception history of the story of Noah as it appears in children's Bibles provides striking examples of the multivalence and malleability of biblical texts, and offers intriguing snapshots of American culture and American religion in their most basic forms. Dalton demonstrates the ways in which children's Bibles reflect and reveal America's diverse and changing beliefs about God, childhood, morality, and what must be passed on to the next generation. Dalton uses the popular story of Noah's ark as a case study, exploring how it has been adapted and appropriated to serve in a variety of social agendas. Throughout America's history, the image of God in children's Bible adaptations of the story of Noah has ranged from that of a powerful, angry God who might destroy children at any time to that of a friendly God who will always keep children safe. At the same time, Noah has been lifted up as a model of virtues ranging from hard work and humble obedience to patience and positive thinking. Dalton explores these uses of the story of Noah and more as he engages the fields of biblical studies, the history of religion in America, religious education, childhood studies, and children's literature.",['Russell W.

Live Good,"Seriously . . . another book that tells you how to live a good life? Don’t we have enough of those? You’d think so. Yet, more people than ever are walking through life disconnected, disengaged, dissatisfied, mired in regret, declining health, and a near maniacal state of gut-wrenching autopilot busyness. Whatever is out there isn’t getting through. We don’t know who to trust. We don’t know what’s real and what’s fantasy. We don’t know how and where to begin and we don’t want to wade through another minute of advice that gives us hope, then saps our time and leaves us empty. How to Live a Good Life is your antidote; a practical and provocative modern-day manual for the pursuit of a life well lived. No need for blind faith or surrender of intelligence; everything you’ll discover is immediately actionable and subject to validation through your own experience. Drawn from the intersection of science, spirituality, and the author’s years-long quest to learn at the feet of masters from nearly every tradition and walk of life, this book offers a simple yet powerful model, the “Good Life Buckets ” —spend 30 days filling your buckets and reclaiming your life. Each day will bring a new, practical yet powerful idea, along with a specific exploration designed to rekindle deep, loving, and compassionate relationships; cultivate vitality, radiance, and graceful ease; and leave you feeling lit up by the way you contribute to the world, like you’re doing the work you were put on the planet to do.

The Impact of Television: A Natural Experiment in Three Communities,"""Does television affect its child and adult viewers, and if so, how? This question has provoked considerable controversy ever since TV first became widely available in the 1950s. Now that most people watch television regularly, the debate is even more difficult to resolve. Do light versus heavy viewers of television differ on some measure because they use television differently, and/or because they differ on some other important characteristic (e.g., intelligence)? Do they differ because they have been influenced by TV? Or is the process of influence transactional? This book describes the results of a large research project based on an unusual opportunity to address these kinds of issues--a natural experiment involving a non-isolated Canadian town which did not obtain TV reception until late 1973. We studied three communities on two occasions, just before one of the towns obtained television for the first time and again 2 years later. The book is not, however, merely a description of who was studied, when, how, and what was found. Our goal is to use this natural experiment to understand the processes involved in television's influence and the complexities of relationships between TV and human behavior""--Publisher description.","['Tannis M.

"Modern Egypt,","This second edition of scholar Arthur Goldschmidt presents a concise survey of Egyptian history since the mid-eighteenth century. It focuses on Egypt's evolution as a nation-state, dispelling common misconceptions about Egypt's modern history. Professor Goldschmidt calls upon recent Egyptian and Western scholarship to document pivotal points, such as the 1952 revolution, and to illuminate controversies, such as those surrounding Sadat's role in the 1973 war with Israel. Modern Egypt is anecdotal as well as authoritative, covering social history, religion, politics, economics, military history, geography, and even the psychology of selected leaders. Faruq's impotence, Nasir's paranoia, and Sadat's glamour are all presented as they relate to policy motivations and outcomes. Modern Egypt paves the way to a clear understanding of events leading up to the Camp David accords of 1978 and then points beyond them to the emergent Muslim opposition, Sadat's assassination, and Mubarak's regime.This book is directed to students, journalists, diplomats, foreign visitors and long-term residents, and businesspeople who need to be familiar with Egypt, its role in Middle East affairs, and its involvement with the nations of the world.""",['Arthur Goldschmidt Jr'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n5A4DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=n5A4DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Modern+Egypt,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Hachette UK,2004-08-13,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=n5A4DgAAQBAJ&dq=Modern+Egypt,&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],1.0

Transport of delight--the mythical conception of rail transit in Los Angeles,"Transport of Delight is a true interdisciplinary work, and includes a thorough analytical assessment of the Los Angeles rail program, with a focus on the Long Beach Blue Line light rail-the first of the new projects to go ahead. En route, it shows that ridership forecasting for this project was not only biased and statistically invalid, but in fact done to justify decisions made on other grounds. This unusual book develops a novel theory of myth to explain the construction of rail passenger transit in Los Angeles when it had little to offer the needs of a dispersed autopolis, whose urgent but dispersed public transportation needs could have been better served by developing the regional bus system. The author conducted interviews and performed the detective work necessary to reveal an unlikely logic that held together a network of symbols, images, and metaphors that together present powerful mythical beliefs in the guise of truth. A political analysis shows how consensus was reached to proceed with the light rail to Long Beach, but political explanations are ultimately found lacking, because they cannot explain why decision-makers would want to put the rail in place. It is only when provocative metaphors-of the need to connect communities and to restore a mythical balance to a dysfunctional transportation system-and symbols-of escape from the pressure cooker of poverty, of urban success, power and, indeed sexual acumen-are surfaced, that we realize that Los Angeles' Transport of Delight is the result of the very human need to transcend complexity by providing mythical creations that appear to offer easy answers to society's deepest problems.",['Jonathan Richmond'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FEAfAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=FEAfAQAAIAAJ&q=Transport+of+delight--the+mythical+conception+of+rail+transit+in+Los+Angeles&dq=Transport+of+delight--the+mythical+conception+of+rail+transit+in+Los+Angeles&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2005,http://books.google.nl/books?id=FEAfAQAAIAAJ&dq=Transport+of+delight--the+mythical+conception+of+rail+transit+in+Los+Angeles&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Technology & Engineering'],

Rupa Goswami uses a metaphor comparing an ocean (sindhu) to a devotional relationship with God. The title of the book conveys that loving relationships are enjoyable like sweet nectar and deep like an ocean. However, devotion is truly only meant for the supreme beloved, Krishna.

The inquiring mind,"In our scientific age an understanding of physics is part of a liberal education. Lawyers, bankers, governors, business heads, administrators, all wise educated people need a lasting understanding of physics so that they can enjoy those contacts with science and scientists that are part of our civilization both materially and intellectually. They need knowledge and understanding instead of the feelings, all too common, that physics is dark and mysterious and that physicists are a strange people with incomprehensible interests. Such a sense of understanding science and scientists can be gained neither from sermons on the beauty of science nor from the rigorous courses that colleges have offered for generations; when the headache clears away it leaves little but a confused sense of mystery. Nor is the need met by survey courses that offer a smorgasbord of tidbit--they give science a bad name as a compendium of information or formulas. The non-scientist needs a course of study that enables him to learn real science and make its own--with delight. For lasting benefits the intelligent non-scientist needs a course of study that enables him to learn genuine science carefully and then encourages him to think about it and use it. He needs a carefully selected framework of topics--not so many that learning becomes superficial and hurried; not so few that he misses the connected nature of scientific work and thinking. He must see how scientific knowledge is built up by building some scientific knowledge of his own, by reading and discussing and if possible by doing experiments himself. He must think his own way through some scientific arguments. He must form his own opinion, with guidance, concerning the parts played by experiment and theory; and he must be shown how to develop a taste for good theory. He must see several varieties of scientific method at work. And above all, he must think about science for himself and enjoy that. These are the things that this book encourages readers to gain, by their own study and thinking. Physics for the Inquiring Mind is a book for the inquiring mind of students in college and for other readers who want to grow in scientific wisdom, who want to know what physics really is.",['Eric M.

Deadly Arts,"""The advent of the crossbow more than 2,500 years ago effected dramatic changes for hunters and warriors. For centuries, it was among the most powerful and widely used handheld weapons, and its popularity endures to this day. A Deadly Art presents a lively, accessible survey of the crossbow's ""golden age,"" along with detailed descriptions of twenty-four remarkable examples. Beginning in the middle ages, the European aristocracy's enthusiasm for the crossbow heralded shooting competitions and pageants that featured elaborately decorated weapons bearing elegant embellishments of rare materials and prized artistry.

Putting Family First: Successful Strategies for Reclaiming Family Life in a Hurry-Up World,"The founders of a lauded family advocacy organization present a guide for reclaiming family life, even in the most hectic households. In the past twenty years, children's free time has declined by twelve hours a week, time spent on structured sports activities has doubled, family dinners are down by a third, and the number of families taking vacations together has decreased by 28 percent. When William J. Doherty and Barbara Z. Carlson observed this trend in their own families and community, they took action and founded Family Life First, an organization committed to helping parents reclaim family time. Doherty and Carlson offer realistic ways to regain valuable family connections and embark on more balanced, meaningful relationships at home. Drawing on their years of hands-on experience, they share tips for time-crunched parents on how to: --get everyone to sit down for family meals --make bedtime a meaningful end to the day --plan family outings and vacations --make time for your marriage More than just a time-management manual, this book delves into the issues that lie at the heart of all family-related choices, revealing innovative ways to address scheduling conflicts, competitiveness, and the many other situations that cause daily angst. Offering a new perspective on a fraying institution, Putting Family First restores a sense of fulfillment, fun, and security to the family once again.","['William J.

Step-Ball-Change,"With a ringing phone, Jeanne Ray’s charming and amusing new novel gets off to a rollicking start that never lets up. Not for a minute. On the other end of the phone is Caroline’s daughter, Kay, a public defender like her father, sobbing at the improbably good news that the richest, most eligible boy in Raleigh, North Carolina, has asked her to marry him. While Caroline and Tom are trying to digest this, the other phone, the “children’s line,” rings; it is Caroline’s sister, Taffy, hysterical over her husband’s decision to leave her for a woman two years younger than her daughter. Soon Taffy is wending her way up from Atlanta to seek solace in her sister’s home, even though the two have been separated by more than just geography for the past forty years. With her is her little dog, Stamp, who has a penchant for biting ankles and stealing hearts. Tom and Caroline quickly realize that the wedding their future son-in-law’s family is envisioning for nine-hundred-plus guests is to be their fiscal responsibility. To top it all off, the foundation of their home is in danger of collapsing and their contractor and his crew have all but moved in. It’s a thundering whirlwind of emotion that finally boils down to: Who is in love with whom? and Who’s going to get the next dance? Wise, funny, and impossible to put down, Step-Ball-Change is peopled with characters you feel you have known your whole life.

The story of how this ragtag collection of words evolved is a winding tale replete with intriguing accidents and bizarre twists of fate. In this eye-opening, fabulously entertaining book, James Essinger unlocks the mysteries that have confounded linguists and scholars for millennia. From the sophisticated writing systems of the ancient Sumerians through the tongue twisters of Middle English, the popular National Spelling Bee, and the mobile phone text-messaging of today, Spellbound chronicles the fascinating history of English spelling, including insights about the vast number of words English has borrowed from other languages (“orange,” “vanilla,” and “ketchup,” to name a few), and how their meanings differ from country to country. Featuring a lively cast of characters ranging from the fictional to the historically noteworthy (Chaucer, Samuel Johnson, Noah Webster, Shakespeare, Bill Gates), this affectionate tribute to English spelling shows why our whimsical, capricious common language continues to hold us spellbound.",['James Essinger'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0BeHcTJhnmEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0BeHcTJhnmEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Spellbound&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Delta,2007-05-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0BeHcTJhnmEC&source=gbs_api,['History'],2.0
Blackbird House,"From the great May storm in 1778 when John Hadley and his sons slip the British blockade off the coast of Massachusetts only to disappear at sea, the lives of the inhabitants of the wooden farmhouse on the cape, stranded amid fields of sweet peas and wild fruit vines and red pear trees, coil and weave around each other, right up to the present. Young Isaac Hadley is more interested in his pet blackbird and the star charts in The Practical Navigator than in helping to build the house; and Violet, a century later, with her stained face and her own ghostly bird, reads the same book, and finds that it's easy enough to trick a learned man, though harder to catch one...Larkin Howard is ready to sell his soul to buy the farm, but meets a woman who hears the whales cry on the beach; while in another century the young Farrell boy sees more than he should on a snowy night- and the pond out back is still dark and unforgiving beneath its deceptively golden lilies. By the 1950s, the farmhouse is part of a community of steady men and wayward boys, and women who make jam but still feel the ghostly breath of Cora Hadley, with her green fingers. As a second century draws to a close and summer visitors from the cities take over the countryside, the house can barely hold all its ghosts, but the tragedies are not over... With a sense of place that is uncanny, and vividly real characters whose lives don't run smooth and whose stories loop together across space and time, this is a remarkable, haunting and accomplished work from a favourite novelist - an irresistible fiction about a house for all seasons.",['Alice Hoffman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bf11D2ZdfiwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=bf11D2ZdfiwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Blackbird+House&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,2013-01-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bf11D2ZdfiwC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],37.0

At its heart was Boagey, whose perverse bullying was targeted at Sue. Her attacks quickly progressed from the gratuitous punishment of an innocent child to sordid gratification of her sexual whims. Sue's story is one of institutional abuse - of physical, mental and emotional torture of the most appalling kind - but it also a story full of joy, humour and many victories - small and large - against her abusers.

Turn South at the Second Bridge chronicles a world that abounds with surprises. Check out Virge Whitfield, who combined wisdom with a limitless love of dogs; or Pat Craddock, whose skill at cooking whiskey cost him a leg; or Jack Hillhouse, the one-armed giant beach-dweller who had an unusual way of obtaining fresh eggs.

These are the sounds that echo against the darkened walls of the Iron Angel music club when Azazel, the Lord of Hell, stirs in his ancient slumber.

Armed only with the wisdom of a pain-riddled mage, an ancient weapon, and her own scattered wits, Amy must hold back the forces of night while battling the demons within. Only one lost soul can defeat the Shredder of Human Souls, and despite her horror, despite her reluctance, despite the fact that it may cost Amy her immortal soul, she must salvage the world from Azazel's hellish tide of unspeakable evil.First in a shocking new horror trilogy by the acclaimed author of Slayer, Scarabus and The Maiden #1: Out of the Ashes.",['Karen Koehler'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nv8WylBJnQ4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nv8WylBJnQ4C&dq=Shredder:+Iron+Angel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Black Death Books,2005-05-30,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nv8WylBJnQ4C&dq=Shredder:+Iron+Angel&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

Encyclopedia of Classical Philosophy,"The Encyclopedia of Classical Philosophy is a reference work on the philosophy of Greek and Roman antiquity. It includes subjects and figures from the dawn of philosophy in Ionia in the 6th century BC to the demise of the Academy in Athens in the 6th century AD. Scholarly study of the texts and philosophical thought of this period has been, during the last half of the 20th century, amazingly productive and has become increasingly sophisticated. The 269 articles in the encyclopedia reflect this development. While the majority of the articles are devoted to individual figures, many of the articles are thematic surveys of broad areas such as epistemology, ethics, and political thought. Some articles focus on particular concepts that evoked significant philosophical treatment by the ancients, and have proved central to later thought. Other articles treat fields that are no longer considered part of philosophy proper, such as mathematics and science. There are articles examining areas of intellectual or cultural endeavour, such as poetry or rhetoric, or genres of philosophical expression, such as dialogue and diatribe. Still others describe the historical developments of philosophical schools and traditions. The encyclopedia includes a chronology and guide to further reading. Best Reference Source",['Donald J.

Dynasties: Fortunes and Misfortunes of the World's Great Family Businesses,"From the author of the New York Times bestseller The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, a fascinating look at the crossroads of kin and coin David S. Landes has earned a reputation as a brilliant writer and iconoclast among economic historians. In his latest acclaimed work, he takes a revealing look at the quality that distinguishes a third of today's Fortune 500 companies: family ownership. From the banking fortunes of Rothschild and Morgan to the automobile empires of Ford and Toyota, Landes explores thirteen different dynasties, revealing what lay behind their successes-and how extravagance, bad behavior, and poor enterprise brought some of them to their knees. A colorful history that is full of surprising conclusions, Dynasties is an engrossing mix of ambition, eccentricity, and wealth.",['David S.

"The ""God"" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","Is Man the product of a God...or is ""God"" the product of human evolution? From the dawn of our species, every human culture-no matter how isolated-has believed in some form of a spiritual realm. According to author Matthew Alper, this is no mere coincidence but rather due to the fact that humans, as a species, are genetically predisposed to believe in the universal concepts of a god, a soul and an afterlife. This instinct to believe is the result of an evolutionary adaptation-a coping mechanism-that emerged in our species to help us survive our unique and otherwise debilitating awareness of death. Spiritual seekers and atheists alike will be compelled and transformed by Matthew Alper's classic study of science and religion. The 'God' Part of the Brain has gained critical acclaim from some of the world's leading scientists, secular humanists, and theologians, and is as a must read for anyone who has pondered the question of God's existence, as well as the meaning of our own. Praise for The ""God"" Part of the Brain ""This cult classic in many ways parallels Rene Descartes' search for reliable and certain knowledge...Drawing on such disciplines as philosophy, psychology, and biology, Alper argues that belief in a spiritual realm is an evolutionary coping method that developed to help humankind deal with the fear of death...Highly recommended.""— Library Journal ""I very much enjoyed the account of your spiritual journey and believe it would make excellent reading for every college student - the resultant residence-hall debates would be the best part of their education. It often occurs to me that if, against all odds, there is a judgmental God and heaven, it will come to pass that when the pearly gates open, those who had the valor to think for themselves will be escorted to the head of the line, garlanded, and given their own personal audience."" — Edward O. Wilson, two-time Pulitzer Prize-Winner ""This is an essential book for those in search of a scientific understanding of man's spiritual nature. Matthew Alper navigates the reader through a labyrinth of intriguing questions and then offers undoubtedly clear answers that lead to a better understanding of our objective reality."" — Elena Rusyn, MD, PhD; Gray Laboratory; Harvard Medical School ""What a wonderful book you have written. It was not only brilliant and provocative but also revolutionary in its approach to spirituality as an inherited trait.""— Arnold Sadwin, MD, former chief of Neuropsychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania ""A lively manifesto...For the discipline's specific application to the matter at hand, I've seen nothing that matches the fury of The 'God' Part of the Brain, which perhaps explains why it's earned something of a cult following."" — Salon.com ""All 6 billion plus inhabitants of Earth should be in possession of this book. Alper's tome should be placed in the sacred writings' section of libraries, bookstores, and dwellings throughout the world. Matthew Alper is the new Galileo...Immensely important...Defines in a clear and concise manner what each of us already knew but were afraid to admit and exclaim.""— John Scoggins, PhD ""Vibrant ... vivacious.

The Rehabilitation of Myth: Vico's 'New Science',"In this important essay, Joseph Mali argues that Vico's New Science must be interpreted according to Vico's own clues and rules of interpretation, principally his claim that the 'master-key' of his New Science is the discovery of myth. Following this lead Mali shows how Vico came to forge his new scientific theories about the mythopoeic constitution of consciousness, society, and history by reappraising, or 'rehabilitating' the ancient and primitive mythical traditions which still persist in modern times. He further relates Vico's radical redefinition of these traditions as the 'true narrations' of all religious, social, and political practices in the 'civil world' to his unique historical depiction of Western civilisation as evolving in a-rational and cyclical motions. On this account, Mali elaborates the wider, distinctly 'revisionist', implications of Vico's New Science for the modern human sciences. He argues that inasmuch as the New Science exposed the linguistic and other cultural systems of the modern world as being essentially mythopoeic, it challenges not only the Christian and Enlightenment ideologies of progress in his time, but also the main cultural ideologies of our time.",['Joseph Mali'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OI9AC1eB9K4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=OI9AC1eB9K4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Rehabilitation+of+Myth:+Vico%27s+%27New+Science%27&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,2002-05-02,http://books.google.nl/books?id=OI9AC1eB9K4C&dq=The+Rehabilitation+of+Myth:+Vico%27s+%27New+Science%27&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],
The American child,"Media and the American Child summarizes the research on all forms of media on children, looking at how much time they spend with media everyday, television programming and its impact on children, how advertising has changed to appeal directly to children and the effects on children and the consumer behavior of parents, the relationship between media use and scholastic achievement, the influence of violence in media on anti-social behavior, and the role of media in influencing attitudes on body image, sex and work roles, fashion, & lifestyle. The average American child, aged 2-17, watches 25 hours of TV per week, plays 1 hr per day of video or computer games, and spends an additional 36 min per day on the internet. 19% of children watch more than 35 hrs per week of TV. This in the face of research that shows TV watching beyond 10 hours per week decreases scholastic performance. In 1991, George Comstock published Television and the American Child, which immediately became THE standard reference for the research community of the effects of television on children. Since then, interest in the topic has mushroomed, as the availability and access of media to children has become more widespread and occurs earlier in their lifetimes. No longer restricted to television, media impacts children through the internet, computer and video games, as well as television and the movies. There are videos designed for infants, claiming to improve cognitive development, television programs aimed for younger and younger children-even pre-literates, computer programs aimed for toddlers, and increasingly graphic, interactive violent computer games.

Jamaica White: The Story of the Witch of Rose Hall,"A very striking and curious story, founded on fact, of the West Indies of the early nineteenth century. Robert Rutherford is sent to the Islands to learn the planter’s business from the bottom. He becomes an overseer at Rosehall, the property of a young widow, Mrs Palmer, whose three husbands have all died in curious circumstances. She takes a violent fancy to Rutherford, who is also embarrassed by the attentions of his half-caste housekeeper, Millicent. His housekeeper is urging him, with some success, to fall in with West Indian habits, when Mrs Palmer arrives. Millicent defies her and threatens her with the powers of Takoo, an Obeah man. Mrs Palmer, herself skilled in Obeah magic, puts a spell on the girl, which Takoo’s rites, shattered by the white woman’s stronger magic, are powerless to remove. “de Lisser utilizes the conventions of a romantic entanglement to investigate and debate the wider socio-political issues within the novel that relate to colonialism, Jamaican identity and culture...

"No Lights, No Sirens: The Corruption and Redemption of an Inner City Cop","A New York Police Officer's relentless journey into the criminal netherworld, told with brutal truth and honesty. Perhaps Neitzsche described Rob Cea's life best, way before he was born: ""Take care when chasing the animals; for you can very well become the animal you are chasing."" No Lights, No Sirens is a sojourn so dirty and nasty it defies belief. Rob Cea starts off as an idealistic young cop, a true believer in the system for which he works tirelessly. He is sadly mistaken. The system he tried so hard to appease ultimately led to his downfall and the ruination of his life. What separates this from other cop—and—robber stories is the brutal authenticity from the cop himself. We will see and hear exactly what is discussed in a patrol car. We will see how the law was—and is—routinely bent to make collars stick any way possible. And we will see how Cea slowly spirals to depths of hell. No Lights, No Sirens is simplistic in its scope: A young idealistic boy becomes a man through fire, and then becomes exactly what he has been chasing for so long, a hardened man possessed by demons. With rapid fire and gritty narrative, Cea writes about his fall to the depths, and his salvation. We see the dark side of detective work in New York's most crime—riddled neighborhoods from a first-hand view never before seen.",['Robert Cea'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8sF2ETr8T4IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8sF2ETr8T4IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=No+Lights,+No+Sirens:+The+Corruption+and+Redemption+of+an+Inner+City+Cop&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Harper Collins,2012-12-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8sF2ETr8T4IC&source=gbs_api,['Law'],1.0

Hooking Up,"Listen to her NPR Interview The Sociology of ""Hooking Up"": Author Interview on Inside Higher Ed Newsweek: Campus Sexperts Hookup culture creates unfamiliar environment - to parents, at least Hooking Up: What Educators Need to Know - An op-ed on CHE by the author It happens every weekend: In a haze of hormones and alcohol, groups of male and female college students meet at a frat party, a bar, or hanging out in a dorm room, and then hook up for an evening of sex first, questions later. As casually as the sexual encounter begins, so it often ends with no strings attached; after all, it was “just a hook up.” While a hook up might mean anything from kissing to oral sex to going all the way, the lack of commitment is paramount. Hooking Up is an intimate look at how and why college students get together, what hooking up means to them, and why it has replaced dating on college campuses. In surprisingly frank interviews, students reveal the circumstances that have led to the rise of the booty call and the death of dinner-and-a-movie. Whether it is an expression of postfeminist independence or a form of youthful rebellion, hooking up has become the only game in town on many campuses. In Hooking Up, Kathleen A. Bogle argues that college life itself promotes casual relationships among students on campus. The book sheds light on everything from the differences in what young men and women want from a hook up to why freshmen girls are more likely to hook up than their upper-class sisters and the effects this period has on the sexual and romantic relationships of both men and women after college. Importantly, she shows us that the standards for young men and women are not as different as they used to be, as women talk about “friends with benefits” and “one and done” hook ups. Breaking through many misconceptions about casual sex on college campuses, Hooking Up is the first book to understand the new sexual culture on its own terms, with vivid real-life stories of young men and women as they navigate the newest sexual revolution.",['Kathleen A.

Negotiating Telecommunications Agreements Line by Line,"In today's business environment, telecommunications is an essential component of any technology infrastructure. To leverage this critical technology to the maximum extent possible in your business, while controlling costs, you must have a thorough understanding of the key terms and provisions commonly found in agreements for telecommunications services. The authors break down the most commonly encountered business and legal issues that arise in these agreements, and detail why and how to modify common clauses to best promote your ability to successfully implement telecom technologies across your business. Businesses have long been at a disadvantage to the vendors in protecting their interests in these types of agreements. Negotiating Telecommunications Agreements Line By Line corrects this imbalance. Examining the most critical components of typical telecom agreements, explaining the business purposes inherent in each, and offering negotiating strategies and proposed contract language, industry expert Mike Dettorre and leading technology lawyers James Kalyvas and Kirk Sullivan present a detailed and strategic insight into the telecommunications contract. A first-ever handbook for the business executive to tackle the challenges presented in buying telecom services, Negotiating Telecommunications Agreements Line By Line illustrates the least understood yet most important clauses encountered in purchasing and implementing telecom systems and services.

How to conduct spiritual warfare: As I see it!,"Have you ever been oppressed by a spiritual or physical infirmity and couldn’t seem to break free? Have you ever wondered how Satan works or what Jesus’ call to “free the captives” means for believers today? In this book, Mary Garrison imparts the wisdom she’s gathered in her years of ministry on how to conduct spiritual warfare. Along with sharing personal experiences and testimonies of people who have broken free from spiritual strongholds, she equips readers to distinguish between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness. Join her in discovering how to effectively engage in spiritual warfare, exploring questions such as… Who is the enemy? How do I recognize Satan’s strategies? How do I discern and try the spirits? By whose authority do believers work? How important is faith in spiritual warfare? This book will prepare you to take action. Every power must yield to the risen Christ. Equipped with His authority, you can cast out demons and set the oppressed free—you can walk in victory!",['Mary Garrison'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=STb2BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=STb2BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=How+to+conduct+spiritual+warfare:+As+I+see+it!&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Whitaker House,2014-04-23,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=STb2BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

Carrier Air Group Commanders: The Men and Their Machines (Schiffer Military History),"The study of the U.S. Navys air group and air wing commanders is a study of carrier aviation itself. This detailed volume presents a history of the establishment of the carrier air group commander billet and the attendant formal air groups. The book is divided into four sections: Section One A Historical Overview, presents an overview of naval aviation history from 1898 to 1922, when the U.S. Navy commissioned its first aircraft carrier USS Langley (CV-1), with its wood-and-fabric biplanes. The pages next describe carrier aviation from Langley to the 90,000-ton supercarriers of today with their supersonic jets. This section also contains air group organization charts showing their development over the years. Section Two Evolving the System, discusses the genesis and evolution of the air group/wing commander billet, as well as the development of the organizations they commanded. It contains biographical sketches of the first CAGs and their wing commander predecessors. Section Three The Men, profiles more than forty of the Navys more notable CAGs by use of their personal reminiscences and anecdotes. Their stories give the reader a feel for the responsibilities, joys and sorrows that accompany the assumption of the title: CAG. Additionally, the profiles give an insiders view of the U.S. Navys combat operation tactics from World War II to Desert Storm. The books final section The Machines, contains a chronological selection of photographs and some profile drawings of the aircraft flown by wing commanders from 1931 to the present. Heavy emphasis has been given to provide as many high-quality color photographs as were possible to locate. This section should have great appeal to both historian and enthusiast in its coverage as it not only graphically presents the aircraft flown, but also covers the evolution of carrier aviation itself. An appendix listing every known CAG and dates of his command concludes the book. lation of this data to exist.

The idea was revived in 1996 when chefs and writers and Elizabeth's many friends, were invited to select their favourite articles and recipes. Some sent notes explaining their choice, others provided an anecdote or a recollection about her, others sent lists of recipes they had been using for years. This book is the fruit of that harvest of recommendations and the names of the contributors, who number among them some of our finest food writers such as Simon Hopkinson, Alice Waters, Sally Clarke, Richard Olney, Paul Levy and Anne Willan, appear after the pieces they had chosen along with their notes. The extracts and recipes which make up ""South Wind Through the Kitchen"" are drawn from all Elizabeth David's books, namely ""A Book of Mediterranean Food"", ""French Country Cooking"", ""Italian Food"", ""Sumer Cooking"", ""French Provincial Cooking"", ""Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen"", ""English Bread and Yeast Cookery"", ""An Omelette and a Glass of Wine"", and ""Harvest of the Cold Months"". There are over 200 recipes in the book organised around courses and ingredients such as eggs and cheese, fish and shellfish, meat, poultry and game, vegetables, pasta, pulses and grains, sauces, sweet dishes and cakes, preserves, and bread, all interspersed with extracts and articles making it a delightful compendium to dip into as well as cook from.","['Elizabeth David', 'Jill Norman']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QV3HRAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=QV3HRAAACAAJ&dq=South+wind%3B&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Grub Street the Basement,2010-10-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=QV3HRAAACAAJ&dq=South+wind%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Cooking'],1.0

Chronic Illness and the Twelve Steps: A Practical Approach to Spiritual Resilience,"When we live with a chronic illness or disability, our spirit is tested. And though we may have no say in our sickness, how we meet its spiritual challenge is entirely up to us. This is the message of Martha Cleveland's heartening book, which maps the spiral of emotional pain that steals the energy of the chronically ill--and shows how to turn this spiral into a path toward spiritual growth. Cleveland herself turned to the Twelve Steps for support during almost two decades of a recurring illness that defied diagnosis. In this book, she shares what the Twelve Step program teaches her about living with chronic illness--coping with feelings of pain, anger, hopelessness, and isolation--and about offsetting such negative emotions with spiritual wellness. An invitation to choose joy over despair, her book reveals how chronic illness can open the spirit to acceptance, serenity, and fulfillment.",['Martha Cleveland'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qHwtmQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=qHwtmQEACAAJ&dq=Chronic+Illness+and+the+Twelve+Steps:+A+Practical+Approach+to+Spiritual+Resilience&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Hazelden Publishing,1999,http://books.google.nl/books?id=qHwtmQEACAAJ&dq=Chronic+Illness+and+the+Twelve+Steps:+A+Practical+Approach+to+Spiritual+Resilience&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Self-Help'],1.0

Scott's Addition,"Born on a snowy night in January 1938, with a drunken father who refused to take his pregnant wife to the hospital, Kenny began his existence in Scotts Addition, a poverty stricken section of intercity Richmond, Virginia. Two years later, his father leaves a sick Kenny with a temperature hovering over one hundred degrees to go hear Glenn Miller play in Philadelphia. While his father is away, only the intervention of a Negro midwife saves the two year olds life. In 1941, Kennys father again leaves, divorcing his mother and leaving her to raise Kenny and his older brother Keith on eighty dollars a month. A loving mother teaches the young Kenny proper moral values and the importance of relationships, but much of his learning must come from the streets, where a boy must fight to survive. Humorously told in personal stories and anecdotes, Kenny gradually develops from an undernourished kid to a teenage product of the rock and roll fifties. On the way, he discovers the meaning of friendship, love and relationships with others. Living with a stern grandfather, Kenny quickly adopts an aversion to garden spiders and shaving straps. Pride and prejudice reign even in the poor community of Scotts Addition as Kenny learns even in church, where Gods love is proclaimed from the pulpit, that prejudice is alive and well. He comes face to face with prejudice when, in his first year of junior high school, the mother of a friend from an exclusive neighborhood refuses to let her son play with Kenny because of where he lives. Kenny and his friends go on escapades searching for fun and excitement. They take an all night camping trip on the James River and traipse through a railroad yard of moving trains. Kenny learns about girls from Della Mays first kiss to his placing an engagement ring on the hand of Kay, his future wife. He experiences all the excitements and depressions of a growing teen in between. At fourteen, he barely survives his first seduction by climbing out of a three-story window. When all is said and done, it is the people of Scotts Addition that have given Kenny the tools to face the world outside. Scotts Addition is a fun look at the forties and fifties and a tribute to the spirit and fortitude of an individual, proving that you can grow up poor and still be enriched.",['Ken Woodcock'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LeRw_KXk2YQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=LeRw_KXk2YQC&pg=PT133&dq=Scott%27s+Addition&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Xlibris Corporation,2001-03-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=LeRw_KXk2YQC&dq=Scott%27s+Addition&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

"Finding the Trapdoor: Essays, Portraits, Travels","For some 30 years, Adam Hochschild’s voice has been one of the most distinctive in American journalism. With grace and wit, he has brought to a startling variety of subjects a combination of adventurous reporting and personal honesty. Hochschild’s readers can count on an unobtrusive erudition, a sense of justice, and an irrepressible curiosity about life. Admirers of Hochschild’s Half the Way Home: A Memoir of Father and Son will find these articles in the same warm autobiographical voice that made the book so memorable: he revisits his time as a civil rights worker in Mississippi, as a New England prep school student, and as a teenager seeing apartheid firsthand in South Africa. But readers will find much more here as well: profiles of an adoptive Gypsy and of a governor general’s son turned revolutionary, essays about Ernest Hemmingway and John F. Kennedy, a journey to one of the most remote corners of the Amazon rain forest, and a remarkable evocation of two of Hochschild’s personal heroes—who, in hillside trenches at the height of the Russian Civil War, faced each other across the battlefield.",['Adam Hochschild'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9A4rDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9A4rDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finding+the+Trapdoor:+Essays,+Portraits,+Travels&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Syracuse University Press,2017-01-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9A4rDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],

The Lucifer Wars,"Something Has Gone Terribly Wrong in Our World Two thousand years after the cross, evil continues to brutalize and pillage in every nation and no one appears able to do very much about it. Why has the church made so little progress? While Satan lost his authority to rule on the earth, he did not lose his power. Failure to recognize this crucial difference has caused us to miss the point as to what the war over the planet is about and therefore, what we must do to win it. Lucifer’s War offers a detailed, historical examination of Satan, the demon gods who are aligned with him, and their ancient struggle with God over humanity. While the church is the only agency on earth authorized by Jesus to deal with evil at its root cause, believers must acknowledge what has not worked and pursue a different strategy that will.

Record of Things Heard,"This Zen classic is a collection of talks by the great Japanese Zen Master Dogen, the founder of the Soto School. They were recorded by Ejo, one of Dogen's first disciples, and later his foremost successor. The talks and stories in this volume were written in the thirteenth-century Japan, a time when Buddhism was undergoing a ""dark age"" of misinterpretation and corruption. It was in this atmosphere that Dogen attempted to reassert the true essence of the Buddhist teachings and to affirm ""the mind of the Way"" and the doctrine of selflessness. Dogen emphasizes the disciplinary aspect of Zen: meditation practice is presented here as the backbone without which Buddhism could not exist. The stories in this volume are often humorous and paradoxical, relating the Buddhist teachings by means of example. Commonly in the Zen tradition, discussions between teacher and student and the telling of tales are used to point to a greater truth, which mere theory could never explain. Dogen relates interesting stories of his travels in China, where the inspiration he found lacking in Japanese Buddhism was flourishing in the Ch'an school of Chinese Buddhism.",['Dogen'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ELkKAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ELkKAAAAYAAJ&q=Record+of+Things+Heard&dq=Record+of+Things+Heard&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Shambhala,1980,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ELkKAAAAYAAJ&dq=Record+of+Things+Heard&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],

"History of the great American fortunes,","Originally published in 1910, a primary source for the business and development of American power in the nineteenth century. As Myers describes in his preface, it was the fashion in the early twentieth century to write of the multi-millionaires in an unfavorable light, as if they were all robber barons and had no social conscience. In his history he was attempting to be more realistic in his perspective. Volume one tells of the colonization of America and the large land grants and the great land fortunes. Volumes two and three cover the great fortunes from railroads, with extensive material on J. P. Morgan in relation to that category. Gustavus Myers (1872-1942) was an American historian who worked on a number of newspapers and magazines in New York City, joined the Populist party and the Social Reform Club, and was a member (1907-12) of the Socialist party. Such books as The History of Tammany Hall (1901), History of the Great American Fortunes (1910), and History of the Supreme Court of the United States (1912) were detailed, realistic exposes through which Myers made his reputation in the muckraking era of American literature.",['Gustavus Myers'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GC1BeLoy1nMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GC1BeLoy1nMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=History+of+the+great+American+fortunes,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","The Minerva Group, Inc.",2002-12,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GC1BeLoy1nMC&dq=History+of+the+great+American+fortunes,&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Biography & Autobiography'],

And Now Let's Move into a Time of Nonsense: Why Worship Songs Are Failing the Church,"Have you ever felt frustrated with the words of the worship songs that we sing? Why are they so forgettable? Why are they filled with such weird language? Where have all the writers gone? Combining humour with strong argument, Nick Page analyses how worship song writers have bought into a disposable, 'pop-song' model; how they have filled their songs with a kind of semi-Biblical code and how songs suffer from poor technique and a lack of specialist lyric writers. Above all it encourages writers to really think about the words of their songs and whether they really communicate truth about God - truth which should lead to worship.

The philosophy of the enlightenment,"In this classic work of intellectual history, Ernst Cassirer provides both a cogent synthesis and a penetrating analysis of one of history's greatest intellectual epochs: the Enlightenment. Arguing that there was a common foundation beneath the diverse strands of thought of this period, he shows how Enlightenment philosophers drew upon the ideas of the preceding centuries even while radically transforming them to fit the modern world. In Cassirer's view, the Enlightenment liberated philosophy from the realm of pure thought and restored it to its true place as an active and creative force through which knowledge of the world is achieved. In a new foreword, Peter Gay considers The Philosophy of the Enlightenment in the context in which it was written--Germany in 1932, on the precipice of the Nazi seizure of power and one of the greatest assaults on the ideals of the Enlightenment. He also argues that Cassirer's work remains a trenchant defense against enemies of the Enlightenment in the twenty-first century.",['Ernst Cassirer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OPmPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=OPmPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+philosophy+of+the+enlightenment&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Princeton University Press,2009-08-30,http://books.google.nl/books?id=OPmPDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+philosophy+of+the+enlightenment&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],

When a gangster's daughter takes a bullet, veterans Jerry Stephens and Paul Coulter trace clues scattered across the country to a Manhattan real-estate magnate. A cold case is reopened; a mother-daughter drowning and a baffling rape/murder are solved. And, finally, Corwin re-creates the investigation surrounding the late Bonny Lee Blakley, allegedly murdered by her actor-husband, Robert Blake.

The Alhambra,"Read the Bldg Blog interview with Mary Beard about the Wonders of the World series (Part I and Part II) The Alhambra has long been a byword for exotic and melancholy beauty. In his absorbing new book, Robert Irwin, Arabist and novelist, examines its history and allure. The Alhambra is the only Muslim palace to have survived since the Middle Ages. Built by a threatened dynasty of Muslim Spain, it was preserved as a monument to the triumph of Christianity. Every day thousands of tourists enter this magnificent site to be awestruck by its towers and courts, its fountained gardens, its honeycombed ceilings and intricate tile work. It is a complex full of mysteries--even its purpose is unclear. Its sophisticated ornamentation is not indiscriminate but full of hidden meaning. Its most impressive buildings were designed not by architects, but by philosophers and poets. The Alhambra, which resembles a fairy-tale palace, was constructed by slave labor in an era of economic decline, plague, and political violence.

King Kelson's Bride,"“Kurtz’s strengths lie in her patient accumulation of telling detail, well-articulated plots, and believable magics. Should bring the fans flocking, and attract newcomers too.”—Kirkus Reviews Speculation runs rampant throughout the kingdom of Gwynedd as to when, and to whom, King Kelson will finally be wed. As a rival monarch takes his rightful place on the throne of a nearby land, it becomes more imperative than ever that Kelson produce a long-awaited heir. With the mystical Deryni blood flowing through his veins, Kelson can only hope for a woman whose power and conviction are equal to his own.

Lizzie Borden,"In Cara Robertson’s “enthralling new book,” The Trial of Lizzie Borden, “the reader is to serve as judge and jury” (The New York Times). Based on twenty years of research and recently unearthed evidence, this true crime and legal history is the “definitive account to date of one of America’s most notorious and enduring murder mysteries” (Publishers Weekly, starred review). When Andrew and Abby Borden were brutally hacked to death in Fall River, Massachusetts, in August 1892, the arrest of the couple’s younger daughter Lizzie turned the case into international news and her murder trial into a spectacle unparalleled in American history. Reporters flocked to the scene. Well-known columnists took up conspicuous seats in the courtroom. The defendant was relentlessly scrutinized for signs of guilt or innocence. Everyone—rich and poor, suffragists and social conservatives, legal scholars and laypeople—had an opinion about Lizzie Borden’s guilt or innocence. Was she a cold-blooded murderess or an unjustly persecuted lady? Did she or didn’t she? An essential piece of American mythology, the popular fascination with the Borden murders has endured for more than one hundred years. Told and retold in every conceivable genre, the murders have secured a place in the American pantheon of mythic horror. In contrast, “Cara Robertson presents the story with the thoroughness one expects from an attorney…Fans of crime novels will love it” (Kirkus Reviews). Based on transcripts of the Borden legal proceedings, contemporary newspaper accounts, unpublished local accounts, and recently unearthed letters from Lizzie herself, The Trial of Lizzie Borden is “a fast-paced, page-turning read” (Booklist, starred review) that offers a window into America in the Gilded Age. This “remarkable” (Bustle) book “should be at the top of your reading list” (PopSugar).",['Cara Robertson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4JPPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4JPPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Lizzie+Borden&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon & Schuster,2020-03-10,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4JPPDwAAQBAJ&dq=Lizzie+Borden&hl=&source=gbs_api,['True Crime'],10.0
The Book of the Secrets of Enoch (Kessinger Publishing's Rare Reprints),"Written by one of the editors of the new complete works of Henry Vaughan, Keeping the Ancient Way is the first book-length study of the poet by a single author for twenty years. It deals with a number of key topics that are central to the understanding and appreciation of this major seventeenth-century writer. These include his debt to the hermetic philosophy espoused by his twin brother (the alchemist, Thomas Vaughan); his royalist allegiance in the Civil War; his loyalty to the outlawed Church of England during the Interregnum; the unusual degree of intertextuality in his poetry (especially with the Scriptures and the devotional lyrics of George Herbert); and his literary treatment of the natural world (which has been variously interpreted from Christian, proto-Romantic, and ecological perspectives). Each of the chapters is self-contained and places its topic in relation to past and current critical debates, but the book is organized so that the biographical, intellectual, and political focus of Part One informs the discussion of poetic craftsmanship in Part Two. A wealth of historical information and close critical readings provide an accessible introduction to the poet and his period for students and general readers alike.

Divided Union: The Politics of War in the Early American Republic (Cornell Studies in Security Affairs),"Between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, the United States was embroiled in competitive inter-state politics. Although it did not directly involve itself in European affairs, the United States did engage regularly in dangerous struggles with other states and with colonial powers with territory on the American periphery. Aside from the War of 1812, the Oregon Crisis, and the Mexican War, other ""near misses"" included here—disputes of 1807 and 1809 with Britain, with Spain over East Florida in 1811–13, with Mexico in 1853, and disputes with Spain over Cuba in 1853–55 and with Mexico in 1858–1860—have been ignored in the democratic peace literature. Scott A. Silverstone finds these cases particularly useful for testing alternative explanations of constraints on armed conflict, because the United States backed down each time, allowing each crisis to pass short of its full potential for violence. Silverstone builds on a nascent theory of institutional constraints on the use of force presented in the Federalist Papers to explain American attitudes toward participation in conflicts. He argues that the federal character of American democracy that emerged from the founding and the large size of the new American republic provide the keys to understanding its decision-making processes. Divided Union shows how the institutional features of federal union and the diverse social, economic, and security interests within this geographically extended republic created political conditions that impeded the use of force by the United States before the Civil War.",['Scott A.

Constantinople in the Age of Justinian,"This is the period of the Great Law-Giver, for Justinian prompted and encouraged the restatement of classical law which remains today one of the monumental achievements in its field. It is one of many fruits of the civilization which combined and transformed the classical Greek and Christian traditions. Justinian was completing the process begun by Constantine the Great (who died in A.D. 337) of forming a new state, a new society, and a new culture to replace the disrupted Roman Empire. As the chief center of the new civilization, Constantinople was the place in which the government, literature, art, and architecture of the new epoch found their fullest expression. With Justinian's own creation, the magnificent church of Sancta Sophia, as its center, Christianity can here be seen transforming the whole Near Eastern world according to its principles. And not the least important part of this masterfully drawn picture is the piety, the daily working of faith, in a society at last dedicated to one God. -- Dust jacket flaps.",['Glanville Downey'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vJhZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vJhZAAAAYAAJ&q=Constantinople+in+the+Age+of+Justinian&dq=Constantinople+in+the+Age+of+Justinian&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Marboro Books,1991,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vJhZAAAAYAAJ&dq=Constantinople+in+the+Age+of+Justinian&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Byzantine Empire'],1.0
Casanova's Homecoming,"Casanova was in his fifty-third year. Though no longer driven by the lust of adventure that had spurred him in his youth, he was still hunted athwart the world, hunted now by a restlessness due to the approach of old age. His yearning for Venice, the city of his birth, grew so intense that, like a wounded bird slowly circling downwards in its death flight, he began to move in ever-narrowing circles. Again and again, during the last ten years of his exile, he had implored the Supreme Council for leave to return home. Erstwhile, in the drafting of these petitions - a work in which he was a past master - a defiant, wilful spirit seemed to have guided his pen; at times even he appeared to take a grim delight in his forwardness. But of late his requests had been couched in humble, beseeching words which displayed, ever more plainly, the ache of homesickness and genuine repentance.",['Arthur Schnitzler'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3kb0LP9wKvQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=3kb0LP9wKvQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Casanova%27s+Homecoming&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,1st World Publishing,2006-07-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=3kb0LP9wKvQC&dq=Casanova%27s+Homecoming&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Collections'],

The Thing (BFI Modern Classics),"An extra-terrestrial alien, capable of replicating any living form it touches, infiltrates an isolated research base in the Antarctic, and sows suspicion and terror among the men trapped there. Which of them is still human, and which a perfect alien facsimile? John Carpenter's The Thing, the second adaptation of John W. Campbell's 1938 novella Who Goes There?, received overwhelmingly negative reviews on its release in 1982, but has since been acknowledged as a classic fusion of the science fiction and horror genres. Now a regular fixture in lists of the greatest movies of all time, it is acclaimed for its inspired and still shocking practical special effects, its deftly sketched characters brought to life by a superb cast, elegant widescreen cinematography, ominous score, and a uniquely tense narrative packed with appropriately ever-changing metaphors about the human condition. Anne Billson's elegant and trenchant study, first published in 1997, was one of the first publications to give the film its due as a modern classic, hailing it as a landmark movie that brilliantly redefined horror and science fiction conventions, and combined them with sly humour, Lewis Carroll logic and disturbingly prescient metaphors for many of the sociopolitical, scientific and medical upheavals of the past three decades. In her foreword to this new edition, Anne Billson reflects upon The Thing's changing fortunes in the years since its release, its influence on film-makers including Tarantino and del Toro, and its topicality in an era of melting ice caps and with humanity besieged by a deadly organism.",['Anne Billson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mAU0EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mAU0EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Thing+(BFI+Modern+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Publishing,2021-09-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mAU0EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Performing Arts'],

Bamboo,"Bamboo -- a major non-wood forest product -- is an ancient woody grass widely distributed in tropical, subtropical and mild temperate zones. It is an integral part of forestry, but is also widely spread outside forests, including farmlands, riverbanks, roadsides and urban areas. Bamboo is quickly changing its image from the ""poor man's tree"" to a high-tech, industrial raw material and substitute for wood. This study, prepared by FAO jointly with the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan, is an initiative to incorporate bamboo into the FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) program. A total of 22 countries responded to the FAO/INBAR call for information and submitted national reports. Although data availability and quality are often weak, the main value of the study is that it has established a systematic methodology and has launched the most comprehensive assessment of global bamboo resources to date.--Publisher's description.","['Maxim Lobovikov', 'Shyam Paudel', 'Lynn Ball', 'Marco Piazza', 'María Guardia', 'Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations', 'Hong Ren', 'Laura Russo', 'Junqi Wu']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LaH8YWXxYWUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=LaH8YWXxYWUC&pg=PA31&dq=Bamboo&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Food & Agriculture Org.,2007,http://books.google.nl/books?id=LaH8YWXxYWUC&dq=Bamboo&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Nature'],

"Nomonhan: Japanese-Soviet tactical combat, 1939 (Leavenworth papers)","Before World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) developed an offensive tactical doctrine designed to allow its infantry forces to fight successfully against a superior foe, the Soviet Union. A battle test of that doctrine's effectiveness occurred from June through August 1939 along the Outer Mongolian-Manchurian border, This essay follows the daily combat operations of the lJA's 2d Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, for a two-month period. During that time, the 2/28th Infantry was in constant contact with Soviet combined arms forces. In July the battalion participated in offensive operations against Soviet units commanded by General Georgi K. Zhukov. When Japanese tactical doctrine failed against a Soviet combined arms force, the Japanese went on the defensive. Japanese officers, however, regarded defensive doctrine as transitional in nature and adopted it only to gain time to prepare for a counterattack. Defensive doctrine dictated that terrain be held until the resumption of offensive operations that would destroy the enemy.",['Edward J.

Enter into the society and culture of post-war Germany still populated by those who believed and supported the philosophy of The Malcontents, a group of former officials in the Nazi regime, whose plan was to convert prestigious works of art into cash as recompense, ultimately financing a resurrection of Aryan Supremacy through political power. Andre Von Kunst, owner of Von Kunst Gallery, Berlin, finds himself fascinated by Katya Preznoski, first violinist with the Polish State Orchestra. Determined to meet her in person, he follows the orchestra across Germany, as his partner, Hannelore Hassenfeld, a friend since childhood, manages the gallery. Unbeknownst to Andre, she continues to perpetuate an illicit plan set up by her father with a group of former Nazi government officials, known as the Kreis, to funnel stolen artworks to the gallery for eventual sale in the U.S. An unlikely turn of events sheds light on personal betrayals, blatant prejudices, unrequited love, and conflicting loyalties, as this intense journey into the German society of the sixties proffers that things are not often what they appear to be.",['Reginald Keith'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l23tq88uxHUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=l23tq88uxHUC&pg=PA99&dq=The+Malcontents&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Tate Publishing,2007-10-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=l23tq88uxHUC&dq=The+Malcontents&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1.0

Teaching Company -- The History of Ancient Rome (The),"For twenty years, the Roman Empire conquered its way through modern-day Germany, claiming all lands from the Rhine to the Elbe. However, when at last all appeared to be under control, a catastrophe erupted that claimed the lives of 10,000 legionnaires and laid Romes imperial ambitions for Germania into the dust. In late September of 9 AD, three Roman legions, while marching to suppress a distant tribal rebellion, were attacked in a four-day battle with the Germanic barbarians. The Romans, under the leadership of the provinces governor, Publius Quinctilius Varus, were taken completely by surprise, betrayed by a member of their own ranks: the German officer and secret rebel leader, Arminius. The defeat was a heavy blow to both Romes military and its pride. Though the disaster was ruthlessly avenged soon afterwards, later attempts at conquering the Germans were half-hearted at best. Four days in September thoroughly examines the ancient sources and challenges the hypotheses of modern scholars to present a clear picture of the prelude to the battle, the fighting itself and its aftermath.",['Jason R.

The Heart of Justice,"The Heart of Justice proposes a new framework of political justice based upon the practice of caring. Integrating the insights of earlier care theorists with the concerns of traditional justice theorists, Engster forges a new synthesis between care and justice, and further argues that the institutional and policy commitments of care theory must be recognized as central to any adequate theory of justice. Engster begins by offering a practice-based account of caring and a theory of obligation that explains why individuals should care for others. He then systematically demonstrates the implications of this account of caring for domestic politics, economics, international relations, and culture. In each of these areas, he reviews the contributions of earlier care theorists and then extends their arguments to provide a more complete description of the institutions and policies of a caring society. Care ethics is further put in dialogue with diverse cultural and religious traditions and used to address the challenges of multicultural justice, cultural relativism, and international human rights. More fully than other works on care theory, this book provides an over-arching account of the institutions and policies of a caring society. The Heart of Justice provides the first full account of a theory of justice based upon care ethics, and should be of interest to anyone interested in thinking about the nature of our moral obligations and the institutions of a just society.",['Daniel Engster'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vwtREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vwtREAAAQBAJ&pg=PA5&dq=The+Heart+of+Justice&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,OUP Oxford,2007-04-26,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vwtREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],

AR15/M16: America'S Assault Rifles,"Whether it's guns and ammunition or multidimensional anti-terrorism systems, the defense industry is dynamic, complex, and ubiquitous. It is also mysterious, powerful, and controversial, involving thousands of players worldwide—from suppliers and producers to government and military procurers to shadowy figures that trade in the black market. This comprehensive, two-volume reference will explore, on a global scale, the various issues, concepts, problems, and controversies surrounding the rise of the modern defense industry. Unparalleled in its scope and insight, The Modern Defense Industry will prove invaluable to the industry's critics and champions alike. The phenomenon of a more-or-less permanent defense industry—especially one so wide in scale, breadth (air, sea, land, and space), technology, and geography—is still relatively new. Until now, its implications for politics, economics, and technology have not been adequately discussed in an authoritative, accessible format for scholars and researchers, business people, journalists, policymakers, and interested laymen. The Modern Defense Industry addresses the period from 1945 to the present, covering the United States, Europe, Russia, China, Israel, and other important arms-producing and arms-procuring countries. Including essays by experts from around the world, a glossary, data on firms and governments, laws and policies, primary documents, case studies, and a host of other elements, this set will be a unique resource for anyone interested in the arms industry. It will also offer penetrating insights into topics like international relations and diplomacy, arms proliferation, and contemporary politics. Volume I comprises chapters by experts in the field on topics like the relationship between the industry, military, and government; how new modes of warfare are changing the industry; the implications of globalization on the industry; the black and gray areas of the arms trade; and much more. Volume II features an extensive A-Z glossary of terms, lists of defense firms and government agencies, annotated primary documents, lists of leading defense contractors and key weapons systems, an analysis of key legislation, and professional organizations. The Modern Defense Industry sets the standard for state of the art overviews of an industry that has, for better or worse, come to infuse nearly every aspect of world affairs in the early twenty-first century.",['Richard A.

"Idiot: Beating ""The Curse"" and Enjoying the Game of Life","Dear Baseball Fan: I know what you’re thinking: Couldn’t he have come up with a better title? My mother agrees with you, but unfortunately Genius just doesn’t have the same ring. Let’s get something straight right away. I may be an idiot, but I’ve tried to do more in this book than just revisit the Red Sox’s Miracle Season. I want to give you a sense of what it’s like to grow up with baseball dreams, to spend long years climbing the ladder, and then over the course of three years to see the building blocks of those dreams fall into place. In this book, you’ll be reading about the son of an Army staff sergeant—a thrill-seeking Orlando kid who at age thirteen was gifted with a man’s body, including rare speed and reflexes. It was some straight talk from my brother that kept me from abandoning that talent, which led to my eventually catching on with the Kansas City Royals and later the Oakland A’s. Starting in 2002 with the Red Sox, I got to see what can happen when a determined front office decides to roll the dice and acquire players who, like me, leave the thinking out of it—who trust their instincts and play team baseball. Forget what you’ve read about the posse of long-haired rebels who eventually made up the 2004 Red Sox. I'll give you the straight dope, including who's got the biggest mouth (hint: his first name is Kevin); what Pedro Martinez was doing all those times when you couldn’t find him on the bench; what game David Ortiz should never play; and why I sometimes question Curt Schilling’s sanity. Memo to Curt: the statue of you is being erected. What’s it like being responsible for the hopes of millions? In the fall of 2004 my teammates and I got to find out. What I’ve tried to do in these pages is bring you inside, show you the black humor that erupted when it seemed we could do nothing right, and the immense joy that followed when 25 guys took turns picking each other up, and by sheer force of will reached baseball’s summit. Red Sox Nation (both natives and new arrivals), this one’s for you. —Johnny Damon, #18","['Johnny Damon', 'Peter Golenbock']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aZsUwl-SZYIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=aZsUwl-SZYIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Idiot:+Beating+%22The+Curse%22+and+Enjoying+the+Game+of+Life&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crown Archetype,2010-02-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aZsUwl-SZYIC&source=gbs_api,['Sports & Recreation'],1.0
Aristotle's Metaphysics,"Martin Heidegger's reading of Aristotle was one of the pivotal influences in the development of his philosophy. First published in German in 1981 as volume 33 of Heidegger's Collected Works, this book translates a lecture course he presented at the University of Freiburg in 1931. Heidegger's careful translation and his probing commentary on the first three chapters of Book IX of Metaphysics show the close correlation between his phenomenological interpretation of the Greeks (especially of Aristotle) and his critique of metaphysics. Additionally, Heidegger's confrontation with Aristotle's Greek text makes a significant contribution to contemporary scholarship on Aristotle, particularly the understanding of potentiality in Aristotle's thought. Finally, the book exemplifies Heidegger's gift for teaching students how to read a philosophical text and how to question that text in a philosophical way.","['Martin Heidegger', 'Aristotle', 'Richard Polt']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u3jGa6XERAoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=u3jGa6XERAoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Aristotle%27s+Metaphysics&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Indiana University Press,1995,http://books.google.nl/books?id=u3jGa6XERAoC&dq=Aristotle%27s+Metaphysics&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],1.0

La sagesse des Chaldeens: Les oracles chaldaiques (Collection Aux sources de la tradition) (French Edition),"Originaires de Babylone, ou naquit l'astrologie, les pretres chaldeens etaient, dans le monde antique, craints et respectes pour leurs connaissances magiques et divinatoires. Leurs pouvoirs miraculeux et leur capacite de dialoguer directement avec les dieux et les ames des morts (en particulier celle de Platon), renforcaient leur influence. Les textes ici rassembles sont ceux des deux plus celebres Chaldeens contemporains de Marc-Aurele (vers 160 de notre ere): Julien-le-Pere et Julien-le-Fils. Lorsque ce dernier etait en communication avec les dieux, le pere interpretait sur-le-champ les visions et les dialogues du fils. Leur renommee extraordinaire, qui dura jusqu'au XVIIe siecle malgre le christianisme, fut assise, notamment, par le celebre miracle de la pluie : en 170, a Vienne, ils sauverent l'Empereur Marc-Aurele, menace d'une debacle due a la canicule, en faisant tomber de violentes averses. Leursoeuvres donnent un rituel detaille des pratiques magiques qui permettent aux oracles de contraindre les dieux a obeir a leur volonte, ainsi que des reponses aux grandes interrogations metaphysiques.",,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uMQQAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=uMQQAQAAIAAJ&pg=PT2&dq=La+sagesse+des+Chaldeens:+Les+oracles+chaldaiques+(Collection+Aux+sources+de+la+tradition)+(French+Edition)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Les Belles Lettres,1993,http://books.google.nl/books?id=uMQQAQAAIAAJ&dq=La+sagesse+des+Chaldeens:+Les+oracles+chaldaiques+(Collection+Aux+sources+de+la+tradition)+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0

At its deepest level, it is a story with universal resonance. But it is also a woman's story and a spiritual quest from a particular point of view.

There she descends into the darkness of a cave, finds the tree of life in the center of a garden, and dances to the strange rhythms of mountain goat songs.

Black Folktales,"Winner of the 2018 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work, Fiction These nearly 150 African American folktales animate our past and reclaim a lost cultural legacy to redefine American literature. Drawing from the great folklorists of the past while expanding African American lore with dozens of tales rarely seen before, The Annotated African American Folktales revolutionizes the canon like no other volume. Following in the tradition of such classics as Arthur Huff Fauset’s “Negro Folk Tales from the South” (1927), Zora Neale Hurston’s Mules and Men (1935), and Virginia Hamilton’s The People Could Fly (1985), acclaimed scholars Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Maria Tatar assemble a groundbreaking collection of folktales, myths, and legends that revitalizes a vibrant African American past to produce the most comprehensive and ambitious collection of African American folktales ever published in American literary history. Arguing for the value of these deceptively simple stories as part of a sophisticated, complex, and heterogeneous cultural heritage, Gates and Tatar show how these remarkable stories deserve a place alongside the classic works of African American literature, and American literature more broadly. Opening with two introductory essays and twenty seminal African tales as historical background, Gates and Tatar present nearly 150 African American stories, among them familiar Brer Rabbit classics, but also stories like “The Talking Skull” and “Witches Who Ride,” as well as out-of-print tales from the 1890s’ Southern Workman. Beginning with the figure of Anansi, the African trickster, master of improvisation—a spider who plots and weaves in scandalous ways—The Annotated African American Folktales then goes on to draw Caribbean and Creole tales into the orbit of the folkloric canon. It retrieves stories not seen since the Harlem Renaissance and brings back archival tales of “Negro folklore” that Booker T. Washington proclaimed had emanated from a “grapevine” that existed even before the American Revolution, stories brought over by slaves who had survived the Middle Passage. Furthermore, Gates and Tatar’s volume not only defines a new canon but reveals how these folktales were hijacked and misappropriated in previous incarnations, egregiously by Joel Chandler Harris, a Southern newspaperman, as well as by Walt Disney, who cannibalized and capitalized on Harris’s volumes by creating cartoon characters drawn from this African American lore. Presenting these tales with illuminating annotations and hundreds of revelatory illustrations, The Annotated African American Folktales reminds us that stories not only move, entertain, and instruct but, more fundamentally, inspire and keep hope alive. The Annotated African American Folktales includes: Introductory essays, nearly 150 African American stories, and 20 seminal African tales as historical background The familiar Brer Rabbit classics, as well as news-making vernacular tales from the 1890s’ Southern Workman An entire section of Caribbean and Latin American folktales that finally become incorporated into the canon Approximately 200 full-color, museum-quality images","['Henry Louis Gates', 'Maria Tatar']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ITtbDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ITtbDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT38&dq=Black+Folktales&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Liveright Publishing,2017-11-14,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ITtbDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Literary Collections'],
Blood in the Sea: HMS Dunedin and the Enigma Code,"This harrowing tale of survival pays moving tribute to the courageous British sailors of World War II, and offers entrance into the ultra-secret world of British code-breaking. In November 1941, the British light cruiser ""HMS Dunedin"" was patrolling the shipping lanes of the central Atlantic, directed to its targets by British intelligence agents who had cracked the German ""Enigma"" code. On November 24, a torpedo from a German U-boat sent her crashing to the ocean floor, along with over 400 of her crew. For three days, 72 desperate survivors clung to the flotsam, fighting off swarming sharks and pounding waves until an American ship stumbled across the scene.",['Stuart Gill'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KYjqIAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=KYjqIAAACAAJ&dq=Blood+in+the+Sea:+HMS+Dunedin+and+the+Enigma+Code&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Weidenfeld & Nicolson,2004-10-07,http://books.google.nl/books?id=KYjqIAAACAAJ&dq=Blood+in+the+Sea:+HMS+Dunedin+and+the+Enigma+Code&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

Altered State: The Story of Ecstacy Culture and Acid House,"From its first publication in 1997, Altered State established itself as the definitive text on Ecstasy and dance culture. This new edition sees Matthew Collin cast a fresh eye on the heady events of the acid house 'Summer of Love' and the rave scene's euphoric escalation into commercial excess as MDMA became a mass-market narcotic. Altered State is the best-selling book on Ecstasy culture, using a cast of memorable characters to track the origins of the scene and its drug through psychedelic subcults, underground gay discos and the Balearic paradise of Ibiza, to the point where Tony Blair was using an Ecstasy anthem as an election campaign song. Altered State critically examines the ideologies and myths of the scene, documenting the criminal underside to the blissed-out image, shedding new light on the social history of the most spectacular youth movement of the twentieth century.",['Matthew Collin'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fc8x9qeCekQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=fc8x9qeCekQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Altered+State:+The+Story+of+Ecstacy+Culture+and+Acid+House&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Profile Books,2010-12-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fc8x9qeCekQC&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],

Camilla Hutchenson, countess, sponsor, darling of the ton, has reached a staggering level of social power.

The man in question, Archibald Warner, is the new Earl of Sachse. Though at first meeting he suspects his new ward of being nothing more than a social bit of fluff, the more time passes, the more he finds himself drawn to her. But there is something she is hiding from him, and she hesitates to show him her real heart, even though she wishes she could learn to trust him with it.

YOURS ARE THE HANDS OF CHRIST THE PRACTICE OF FAITH,"Take spirituality into the real world. Jesus didn't ""become flesh"" so we could feel different. He came to this world so we will be different. Often our spirituality seems invisible and mute to a hurting world. Many of us simply internalize faith out of fear, feelings of inadequacy, or choice. A faithful response to discipleship's call, however, is both inward and outward. Through Howell's study, you'll find ways to apply faith to your daily life and make evident your commitment to Christ. By considering all that Jesus did with his hands as a teacher, a healer, and a compassionate servant, Howell challenges readers to be the hands and feet and love of Christ in the world. ""Christianity must become something real, tangible, something that pervades all that we are,"" writes Howell. ""It must become something we do. In our culture, for Christianity to have any meaningful future, we must get serious about a genuine lifestyle that is holy without being elitist, engaged with the world without being jaded or self-righteous, active and busy yet prepared to cope with failure."" Howell's inspiration for this work comes from a poetic meditation written by Teresa of Avila, a Spanish nun who lived in the 16th century. The poem begins: ""Christ has no body now on earth but yours, no hands but yours, no feet but yours."" Howell connects these words with the apostle Paul, who wrote in 1 Corinthians 12: ""Now you are the body of Christ."" Express your faith through action. Be the hands of Christ today to a hurting world.",['James C.

Selected Poetry of Blake,"Writer and religious rebel, William Blake sowed the seeds of Romanticism in his innovative poems concerning faith and the vision that inspired him throughout his remarkable life. Whether describing his own spirituality, the innocence of youth, or the corruption caused by mankind, his writings depict a world in which spirits dominate and the mind is the gateway to Heaven. Presenting many of Blake’s major works in their complete texts, alongside extensive passages from such poems as ""Jerusalem"" and ""The Gates of Paradise,"" this collection spans his entire poetic life, from the exquisite lyrics of Poetic Sketches to Songs of Innocence and Experience—a compelling exploration of good and evil. Together, they illuminate a self-made realm that has fascinated artists and poets as diverse as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Yeats, and Ginsberg. This is the perfect introduction to Blake’s unforgettable poetry. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Lost Earth: A Life of Cezanne,"Only now can we see Paul Cézanne as the invisible genius at the very inception of modern art. Recent exhibitions of his early works reveal an artist very different from the serene landscapist we thought we knew. What was it that made these disturbingly dark and troubled paintings, with their violence and psychological truth, as important to him as, later, his huge series of bathers, an obsession with the nude that continued to the end? With the last full-length biography written more than a quarter century ago, the demand for a new life of Cézanne has never been greater. In Lost Earth, Philip Callow delivers it brilliantly. Using contemporary sources, exceptional biographical skills, and a poetic prose, Callow finds beneath an outwardly uneventful life a wealth of anguish and bitter struggle to overcome personal inadequacies and the insults of the critical community. For all of Cézanne's weakness and despair, Lost Earth is the story of a transcendent artist who was passionately committed to a tradition he would one day transform. Callow examines with fresh insights Cézanne's profound friendship with Émile Zola, his ingrained fear of women, his love of the outdoors that enabled him to paint the universe in an apple. Lost Earth gets to the heart of the great painter. With 8 pages of photographs and color plates.",['Philip Callow'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xcYAAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=xcYAAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Lost+Earth:+A+Life+of+Cezanne&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Ivan R.

Having rolled her out of harm’s way, he can’t deny that he is intrigued by the soft, delicate woman, especially when she races away without telling him her name.

Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic,"Redmond O'Hanlon describes his extraordinary three-week trip on an Orkney trawler as it journeys far into the north Atlantic in search of its catch. Young skipper Jason Schofield has a 2 million pound overdraft on his boat, the Norlantean, which is why he has to go out in a Category One Force 12 hurricane when the rest of the Scottish fleet has run for shelter. O'Hanlon may not be much help when it comes to seamanship - in the words of one of the crew, he doesn't know his arse from his tit - but he is able to wax lyrical on the amazing deep-sea fish to be found north of the Wyville Thomson Ridge: greater argentine, flying squid, blue ling, the truly disgusting hagfish and many other exotics. Combining humour with erudition, O'Hanlon has written a vivid and compulsively readable account of a journey that for sheer terror beats all his previous adventures.","[""Redmond O'Hanlon""]",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mYWlIC8yVjMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mYWlIC8yVjMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Trawler:+A+Journey+Through+the+North+Atlantic&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin UK,2004-06-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mYWlIC8yVjMC&source=gbs_api,['Travel'],9.0

"Tribute to Freud; Writing on the Wall, Advent.","A classic of American literature, now with a new introduction by iconic author and psychotherapist Adam Phillips. “My bat-like thought-wings would beat painfully in that sudden searchlight,” H.D. writes in Tribute to Freud, her moving memoir. Compelled by historical as well as personal crises, H.D. underwent therapy with Freud during 1933–34, as the streets of Vienna were littered with tokens dropped like confetti on the city stating “Hitler gives work,” “Hitler gives bread.” Having endured World War I, she was now gathering her resources to face the cataclysm she knew was approaching. The first part of the book, “Writing on the Wall,” was composed some ten years after H.D.’s stay in Vienna; the second part, “Advent,” is a journal she kept during her analysis. Revealed here in the poet’s crystal shard-like words and in Freud’s own letters (which comprise an appendix) is a remarkably tender and human portrait of the legendary Doctor in the twilight of his life.

We need a spiritual practice that recognizes not only that same-sex love is possible, but that our love can powerfully energize a deep quest for Self-awareness and enlightenment.

Fishing for Irene,"Fishing for Irene is a work of fiction about a family whose lives are torn apart by a tragic, debilitating mental illness. The story is primarily about the mother; however, the experience of the reader is realized through the eyes of the daughter who is compassionate, funny, and wise. Mental illness is handled thoughtfully in this book, cultivating within the reader a sense of urgency and yearning. Powerful, moving, and dramatic scenes urge the reader to dig deep for faith, and if extracted to hope against hope for a bearable resolve. Ultimately, it is within faith where the resolve rests. Set in Western Montana during the last half of the twentieth century, Fishing for Irene promises the reader an open, honest view of the delicacy of mental illness.",['Margee Driscoll'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N9TAAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=N9TAAAAACAAJ&dq=Fishing+for+Irene&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Publishamerica Incorporated,2004-12,http://books.google.nl/books?id=N9TAAAAACAAJ&dq=Fishing+for+Irene&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

The Lewis and Clark Companion: An Encyclopedic Guide to the Voyage of Discovery,"An indispensable guide to our nation's epic adventure The years 2003-2006 mark the bicentennial of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark's famous transcontinental journey between the Missouri and the Columbia River systems. They never did find the fabled Northwest Passage, but over twenty-eight months, the Corps of Discovery traveled more than eight thousand miles through eleven future states, named scores of places and rivers, met with many Native American tribes, and wrote the first descriptions of heretofore unknown plants and animals. By the end of their trip, Lewis and Clark had navigated and named two thirds of the American continent. They may have had undaunted courage, but the sheer volume of information related to their expedition can be more than a little daunting to the armchair historian. Written by two highly regarded Lewis and Clark experts, this book contains over five hundred lively and fascinating entries on everything from the members of the expedition and the places they went to the weapons and tools, trade goods, and medicines they carried, along with the food and amusements that sustained them. Highly readable and informative, it's the perfect introduction for the Lewis and Clark novice, and the comprehensive guide no buff will want to be without. ""This handy volume, timed for publication as the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition opens, has the virtue of teaching the student while helpfully reminding the scholar.

Then the constitutive nature of the chapter topic is presented, followed by a link between mechanics and materials concepts. Details of analysis and materials selection are subsequently discussed. * A concluding example design problem is provided in most chapters, so that students may get a sense of how mechanics and materials come together in the design of a real structure. * Exercises are provided that are germane to aerospace, civil, and mechanical engineering applications, and include both deterministic and design-type problems. * Accompanying website contains a wealth of information complementary to this text, including a set of virtual labs.

The pure theory of capital,"F. A. Hayek’s long-overlooked volume, was his most detailed work in economic theory. Originally published in 1941 when fashionable economic thought had shifted to John Maynard Keynes, Hayek’s manifesto of capital theory is now available again for today’s students and economists to discover. With a new introduction by Hayek expert Lawrence H. White, who firmly situates the book not only in historical and theoretical context but within Hayek’s own life and his struggle to complete the manuscript, this edition commemorates the celebrated scholar’s last major work in economics. Offering a detailed account of the equilibrium relationships between inputs and outputs in an economy, Hayek’s stated objective was to make capital theory ""useful for the analysis of the monetary phenomena of the real world.” His ambitious goal was nothing less than to develop a capital theory that could be fully integrated into the business cycle theory.",['F.

Star Bores: The Novel,"This enhanced eBook transforms The Making of Star Wars into an immersive multimedia experience worthy of the original film. It features exclusive content pulled from the Lucasfilm archives by author J. W. Rinzler: • 26 minutes of rare behind-the-scenes video* • 29 minutes of rare audio interviews with the cast and crew • New bonus photos and artwork not found in the print edition After the 1973 success of American Graffiti, filmmaker George Lucas made the fateful decision to pursue a longtime dream project: a space fantasy movie unlike any ever produced. Lucas envisioned a swashbuckling SF saga inspired by the Flash Gordon serials, classic American westerns, the epic cinema of Japanese auteur Akira Kurosawa, and mythological heroes. Its original title: The Star Wars. The rest is history, and how it was made is a story as entertaining and exciting as the movie that has enthralled millions for more than thirty years—a story that has never been told as it was meant to be. Until now. Using his unprecedented access to the Lucasfilm Archives and its trove of “lost” interviews, photos, production notes, factoids, and anecdotes, Star Wars scholar J. W. Rinzler hurtles readers back in time for a one-of-a-kind behind-the-scenes look at the nearly decade-long quest of George Lucas and his key collaborators to make the “little” movie that became a phenomenon. It’s all here: • the evolution of the now-classic story and characters—including “Annikin Starkiller” and “a huge green-skinned monster with no nose and large gills” named Han Solo • excerpts from George Lucas’s numerous, ever-morphing script drafts • the birth of Industrial Light & Magic, the special-effects company that revolutionized Hollywood filmmaking • the studio-hopping and budget battles that nearly scuttled the entire project • the director’s early casting saga, which might have led to a film spoken mostly in Japanese—including the intensive auditions that won the cast members their roles and made them legends • the grueling, nearly catastrophic location shoot in Tunisia and the subsequent breakneck dash at Elstree Studios in London • the who’s who of young film rebels who pitched in to help—including Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, and Brian DePalma But perhaps most exciting, and rarest of all, are the interviews conducted before and during production and immediately after the release of Star Wars—in which George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Sir Alec Guinness, Anthony Daniels, composer John Williams, effects masters Dennis Muren, Richard Edlund, and John Dykstra, Phil Tippett, Rick Baker, legendary production designer John Barry, and a host of others share their fascinating tales from the trenches and candid opinions of the film that would ultimately change their lives. No matter how you view the spectrum of this phenomenon, The Making of Star Wars stands as a crucial document—rich in fascination and revelation—of a genuine cinematic and cultural touchstone. *Video may not play on all readers.

The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (BFI Film Classics),"Winston Churchill hated The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, and tried to have it banned when it was released in 1943. But Martin Scorsese, a champion of directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, considers it a masterpiece. It's a film about desires repressed in favour of worthless and unsatisfying ideals. And it's a film about how England dreamt of itself as a nation and how this dream disguised inadequacy and brutality in the clothes of honour. A. L. Kennedy, writing as a Scot, is fascinated by the nationalism which The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp explores. She finds human worth in the film and the pathos of stifled emotions and unfulfilled lives. 'If he is unaware of his passions, ' she writes of Clive Candy, the film's central figure, 'this is because his pains have become habitual, a part of personality, and because he was never taught a language that could speak of emotions like pain.'. This edition includes a foreword by the author exploring the film's continuing relevance in an age of Brexit, when English and British national identity are deeply contested concepts.",['A.L.

Spanish Eyes,"Historical and literary works from the Spanish Golden Age offer a wealth of information about the Spanish view of the conflict in the Netherlands during the Dutch Revolt and the ensuing Eighty Years' War (1568-1648). The war in the cold north was to become a fixed component in the lives of the Spaniards of the Golden Age for many years. This book reconstructs the images that the Spanish had of the Netherlands and its inhabitants. These images are inextricably intertwined with the picture that the Spanish constructed of themselves as participants in the conflict. This book follows the developments of these images from the construction of an image of the enemy that reached a climax between 1621 and 1648 and then gradually faded away. Which images and representations circulated the most, and where did they come from? Which rhetoric was used to present them to the public, and in which genres and contexts were they disseminated and preserved? On the basis of a varied collection of sources, war chronicles and plays, as well as pamphlets, poems, historical works and prose writings, the author illustrates the appearance of the Netherlands through Spanish eyes during the course of the Eighty Years' War.",['Yolanda Rodríguez Pérez'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8h-_H4APTQUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=8h-_H4APTQUC&pg=PA12&dq=Spanish+Eyes&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Peter Lang,2008,http://books.google.nl/books?id=8h-_H4APTQUC&dq=Spanish+Eyes&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],
WONDER BOY,"Twb is the story of a boy who has been gifted with some special powers to access information bases. However, the purpose of the book is not simply to demonstrate how important correct information is for making useful decisions. However, the real purpose of this book is to emphasize on everyone, i.e., people of all ages, the importance of maintaining their initial instincts of siding with good, right and truth. It is a well known fact that as we grow older, we tend to lose our innocence and develop various types of barriers to defend the positions that we believe we have been forced to adopt in our lives for the sake of our survival. Twb believes that to the extent possible, we must all struggle to maintain our clear conscience that was given to us when we were born. It is this endeavor on the part of all persons alive on this planet that will achieve the much desired goals of peace and stability around the world, which will then lead to a reduction of disequilibrium and promote social good.",['Bobby John'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dAx-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=dAx-DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT325&dq=WONDER+BOY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Xlibris Corporation,2018-12-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dAx-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

Land of unreason,"On Midsummer's Eve, as everybody knows, you should leave a bowl of milk out for the fairies. Unfortunately - or fortunately - Fred Barber, an American diplomat convalescing in Yorkshire, didn't take the obligation with proper seriousness. He swapped the milk for a stiff dose of Scotch. So he had only himself to blame if the fairies got a bit muddled. Barber found himself in an Old English Fairyland. At the Court of King Oberon, to be precise. The natural - or supernatural - laws there were, to say the least of it, distinctly odd. Things kept changing. This made the mssion with which he was entrusted, as the price of his return to the normal world, even harder than he expected. He had to penetrate the Kobold Hills, where it was said that swords were being made, and discover if an ancient enemy had returned. He was given a magic wand - but not told how to use it. Through the fields and forests he went, meeting dryads and sprites, ogres and two-headed eagles, on the way. Danger, seduction and magic lay all around him. And, as the adventure continued, somehow it darkened and became more seriousness. At the end of Fred Barber's quest lay a shattering revelation.","['L.

Blind Reason,"Blind Reason is the intricate tale of the most ambitious and insidious global conspiracy since the Third Reicha tangled web of insatiable greed, hidden agendas, rogue spies, deception, betrayal, lost dreams, and personal tragedies. It begins with the Allied nations' bombing of Berlin in February 1945, which destroyed the Reichsbank, and the subsequent discovery of an abandoned salt mine in southern Germany, where an incalculable stash of gold bullion, currency, and precious art and antiques has been stored for the express purpose of financing the continuation of the Nazis' thousand-year reign. Maya Warwick is an enigmatic and reclusive author living in a mountain community outside Denver. When she discovers that her best friend, Thea Rousseau, has committed suicide, her only clue is an empty bottle of Euphorin, the latest Prozac-like ""mood brightener"" touted as a panacea for anxiety and depression. Maya is no stranger to bad drugs slipping through the FDA approval process. Ten years earlier, she wrote a best-selling book on another pharmaceutical that was implicated in dozens of grisly tragedies, including the murder-suicide of her parents. Fearing that Thea's actions were a side effect of the medication, Maya uses the Internet to research Euphorin and its manufacturer. She discovers that FetcherBurkeWinslow is a subsidiary of VB Pharmaceuticals (referred to as the ""poison machine of the Third Reich"") and that VB was the maker of the psychotropic drugs used in mind-control experiments at Auschwitz. She now suspects that Euphorin has a more sinister intent. From there, her investigation leads to various neo-Nazi websites where she learns that Baron Alexander von Brandt, president of VB Pharmaceuticals, is the reputed leader of a burgeoning Nazi party and the son of a former Third Reich minister. In her outrage, Maya innocently posts her conspiracy theories on various Internet bulletin boards alleging that the Nazis are trying to wrangle the bleating herds into a planetary corral, attracting the attention of a couple of CIA lurkers who have been monitoring certain websites since the 9-11 terrorist attacks. She is lured into an online relationship with one of the lurkers and eventually meets the man in charge of the infamous CIA experiments known as Project MK-Ultra. Riggs Haywood ardently recruits Maya into Operation SHADOWHAWK, a black project set up to entrap Baron von Brandt into disclosing his plans for advancing the new Nazi party. More importantly, Riggs wants to know how von Brandt intends to access the vast sum of money and gold that was stashed in Credit Suisse by his father before the collapse of the Third Reich. The Schweizerische Bundespolizei want to know the same thing. Once recruited, Maya is assigned a new name and identity and is sent to Munich to be squired to Baron von Brandt's lavish Christmas extravaganza by a nefarious CIA sleeper named Horst Freundlich. It then becomes her mission to ferret out von Brandt's intentions. After several meetings, he discloses his vision of a future world comprised of genetically engineered people whose lives are enhanced by pharmaceuticals that induce neurochemical bliss. Several attempts are made on her life before Harry Langdon, one of the lurkers who helped ensnare her in this diabolical plot, rescues her. Both he and Maya seek asylum in Switzerland under the auspices of Swiss intelligence. Most of the action takes place in Munich, but also includes scenes in New York; Provence, Switzerland; and Colorado. In the end, each of the characters finds the will to overcome the events that have shaped their lives and reclaim their right to find real love and personal happiness in a world that seems fraught with illusion.",['Patricia Griffon'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=soCIDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=soCIDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT289&dq=Blind+Reason&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Xlibris Corporation,2016-11-18,http://books.google.nl/books?id=soCIDQAAQBAJ&dq=Blind+Reason&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

The Education of a Wasp,"Brimming with honestly and passion, The Education of a WASP chronicles one white woman's discovery of racism in 1960s America. First published in 1970 and highly acclaimed by reviewers, Lois Stalvey's account is as timely now as it was then. Nearly twenty years later, with ugly racial incidents occurring on college campuses, in neighborhoods, and in workplaces everywhere, her account of personal encounters with racism remains deeply disturbing. Educators and general readers interested in the subtleties of racism will find the story poignant, revealing, and profoundly moving. “Delightful and horrible, a singular book.” —Choice “An extraordinarily honest and revealing book that poses the issue: loyalty to one’s ethnic group or loyalty to conscience.” —Publishers Weekly",['Lois M.

Statistical Physics,"Written by a world-renowned theoretical physicist, Introduction to Statistical Physics, Second Edition clarifies the properties of matter collectively in terms of the physical laws governing atomic motion. This second edition expands upon the original to include many additional exercises and more pedagogically oriented discussions that fully explain the concepts and applications. The book first covers the classical ensembles of statistical mechanics and stochastic processes, including Brownian motion, probability theory, and the Fokker–Planck and Langevin equations. To illustrate the use of statistical methods beyond the theory of matter, the author discusses entropy in information theory, Brownian motion in the stock market, and the Monte Carlo method in computer simulations. The next several chapters emphasize the difference between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics—the quantum phase. Applications covered include Fermi statistics and semiconductors and Bose statistics and Bose–Einstein condensation. The book concludes with advanced topics, focusing on the Ginsburg–Landau theory of the order parameter and the special kind of quantum order found in superfluidity and superconductivity. Assuming some background knowledge of classical and quantum physics, this textbook thoroughly familiarizes advanced undergraduate students with the different aspects of statistical physics.

Convincing Minds and Moving Hearts,"A History of Preachingbrings together narrative history and primary sources to provide the most comprehensive guide available to the story of the church's ministry of proclamation. Bringing together an impressive array of familiar and lesser-known figures, Edwards paints a detailed, compelling picture of what it has meant to preach the gospel. Pastors, scholars, and students of homiletics will find here many opportunities to enrich their understanding and practice of preaching. Volume 1, appearing in the print edition, contains Edwards's magisterial retelling of the story of Christian preaching's development from its Hellenistic and Jewish roots in the New Testament, through the late-twentieth century's discontent with outdated forms and emphasis on new modes of preaching such as narrative. Along the way the author introduces us to the complexities and contributions of preachers, both with whom we are already acquainted, and to whom we will be introduced here for the first time. Origen, Chrysostom, Augustine, Bernard, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Wesley, Edwards, Rauschenbusch, Barth; all of their distinctive contributions receive careful attention. Yet lesser-known figures and developments also appear, from the ninth-century reform of preaching championed by Hrabanus Maurus, to the reference books developed in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries by the mendicant orders to assist their members' preaching, to Howell Harris and Daniel Rowlands, preachers of the eighteenth-century Welsh revival, to Helen Kenyon, speaking as a layperson at the 1950 Yale Beecher lectures about the view of preaching from the pew. Volume 2, contained on the enclosed CD-ROM, contains primary source material on preaching drawn from the entire scope of the church's twenty centuries. The author has written an introduction to each selection, placing it in its historical context and pointing to its particular contribution. Each chapter in Volume 2 is geared to its companion chapter in Volume 1's narrative history. Ecumenical in scope, fair-minded in presentation, appreciative of the contributions that all the branches of the church have made to the story of what it means to develop, deliver, and listen to a sermon, A History of Preachingwill be the definitive resource for anyone who wishes to preach or to understand preaching's role in living out the gospel. ""...'This work is expected to be the standard text on preaching for the next 30 years,' says Ann K. Riggs, who staffs the NCC's Faith and Order Commission. Author Edwards, former professor of preaching at Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, is co-moderator of the commission, which studies church-uniting and church-dividing issues. 'A History of Preaching is ecumenical in scope and will be relevant in all our churches; we all participate in this field,' says Riggs...."" from EcuLink, Number 65, Winter 2004-2005 published by the National Council of Churches","['O.C.

"Germany's Tiger Tanks D.W. to Tiger I: Design, Production & Modifications","This first volume, of a three-volume set, covers the history, development and production history of the Tiger tank variants from the idea's conception to the end of Tiger I production. This includes details on the development series known as the D.W., VK 30.01(H), VK 30.01(P), VK 36.01(H), VK 45.01(P) as well as the Tiger I. All of this illustrated with scale drawings by Hilary L. Doyle, combined with drawings, sketches, and photographs depicting external modifications as well as internal views. Over thirty years of intensive research went into finding the original documents needed to create this history of the development, characteristics, and tactical capabilities of the Tiger. An exhaustive search was made for surviving records of the design/assembly firms (including Krupp, Henschel, Porsche, and Wegmann), the Heereswaffenamt, the Generalinspekteur der Panzertruppen, the D656 series of manuals on the Tiger, and the war diaries with their supporting reports from German army units. This is supplemented by the authors' collecting hundreds of photos and climbing over, under, around, and through nearly every surviving Tiger I. AUTHOR:","['Thomas L. Jentz', 'Hilary L.

Vortex,"A highly original theory of how the mind-brain works, based on the author's study of single neuronal cells. In I of the Vortex, Rodolfo Llinas, a founding father of modern brain science, presents an original view of the evolution and nature of mind. According to Llinas, the ""mindness state"" evolved to allow predictive interactions between mobile creatures and their environment. He illustrates the early evolution of mind through a primitive animal called the ""sea squirt."" The mobile larval form has a brainlike ganglion that receives sensory information about the surrounding environment. As an adult, the sea squirt attaches itself to a stationary object and then digests most of its own brain. This suggests that the nervous system evolved to allow active movement in animals. To move through the environment safely, a creature must anticipate the outcome of each movement on the basis of incoming sensory data. Thus the capacity to predict is most likely the ultimate brain function. One could even say that Self is the centralization of prediction. At the heart of Llinas's theory is the concept of oscillation. Many neurons possess electrical activity, manifested as oscillating variations in the minute voltages across the cell membrane. On the crests of these oscillations occur larger electrical events that are the basis for neuron-to-neuron communication. Like cicadas chirping in unison, a group of neurons oscillating in phase can resonate with a distant group of neurons. This simultaneity of neuronal activity is the neurobiological root of cognition. Although the internal state that we call the mind is guided by the senses, it is also generated by the oscillations within the brain. Thus, in a certain sense, one could say that reality is not all ""out there,"" but is a kind of virtual reality.",['Rodolfo R.

"Still-life paintings from the Netherlands, 1550-1720","This stunning book presents the very best still lifes produced in the Netherlands at the height of the genre, from the early beginnings in the 16th century, with Pieter Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer, to the late highlights in the 18th century, with Rachel Ruysch and Jan van Huysum. Despite the popularity and abundance of flower paintings in modern collections, the book includes a wide range of subjects and styles, from the simple to the complex, the charmingly small to the opulent and extravagant, and from flowers to hunting still lifes or objects in the corner of a painter's studio, along with an occasional trompe l'oeil. The visual delights of still-life painting have a strong historical context. Collectors and connoisseurs purchased them because of their realism, visual appeal, and relevance to their own lives. Poets praised the wonders of still-life paintings and evoked the power of painting to transcend the seasons and the passing of time. Contemporary observers lauded the expensive and elaborate objects often on display. The book therefore considers the visual achievement of the Netherlandish still life painters in the context of contemporary reactions to pictures, art theory, and issues of patronage. Numerous artists were tempted to try their hand at still life, drawn by a new and enchanting genre that allowed an artist to create independent worlds of inanimate objects on the flat surface of a picture -- imaginary realms that had an exceptional following among connoisseurs of the time. These images continue to work their magic on present-day art lovers.","['Alan Chong', 'W.

"A Greek reader,","Scholarly commentary on the nuances of Greek writing fills library shelves, even entire libraries. Yet nothing can take the place of the documents themselves. The Classical Greek Reader marks an exciting departure from the traditional anthology approach to Greek literature and thought. By focusing not only on the big names but also on the less-familiar voices--the women, doctors, storytellers, herbalists, and romance writers--we are offered a glimpse of ancient Greece as we have rarely seen it. Kenneth J. Atchity provides the reader with firsthand access to literary, artistic, social, political, religious, scientific, and philosophical texts that shaped Greek thinking. From Homeric epics to the histories of Plutarch, and from the poems of Korinna to the romances of Heliodorus, this invaluable reference provides readers with modern translations of the voices that shaped the classical Greek spirit. Each entry contains an introduction identifying the author and providing information that allows readers to consider these ancient texts in a new light. Here are the wonders of the Greek world presented in a modern, accessible manner, perfect for those looking to refresh their acquaintance with the classics and for those who have yet to explore the exciting intellectual energy of the ancient Greek world.","['Kenneth John Atchity', 'Rosemary McKenna']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rHJjAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rHJjAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Greek+reader,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","Oxford University Press, USA",1996,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rHJjAgAAQBAJ&dq=A+Greek+reader,&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Literary Criticism'],

IBM's Early Computers: A Technical History (History of Computing),"In describing the technical experiences of one company from the beginning of the computer era, this book unfolds the challenges that IBM's research and development laboratories faced, the technological paths they chose, and how these choices affected the company and the computer industry. It chronicles the transformation of IBM into a computer company in a remarkably few years, discussing projects that ended in frustration as well as the more successful ones, and providing a sense of the atmosphere, the people, and the decision-making processes involved during the company's rapid technological transformation. IBM's Early Computers is a unique contribution to the modern history of computers. It focuses on engineering alternatives rather than business and general management considerations and reveals the significance of imaginative solutions to problems in design and technology, from initial experiments with electronics in digital machines to the threshold of the System 360 era. This fair and balanced account of IBM's role in shaping today's electronic revolution identifies the individuals (both inside and outside the company) whose pioneering work influenced developments at IBM. The book's fourteen chapters briefly survey the card machine era and then cover electronic calculation, the magnetic drum calculator, the Defense Calculator and other first-generation products, ferrite core memories, magnetic tape, and disk storage development, programming, transistors, ""Project Stretch"" (which involved disappointments but led to one of IBM's greatest successes) high-speed printers, research, and new-product-line considerations. Charles J. Bashe, Lyle R. Johnson, John H. Palmer, and Emerson W Pugh are senior members of the staff at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, each with many years of technical and managerial experience in the developments they describe. IBM's Early Computers is included in the History of Computing Series, edited by I. Bernard Cohen and William Aspray.",['Charles J.

A Subtler Magick: The Writings and Philosophy of H. P. Lovecraft,"He was the premier writer of horror fiction in the first half of the 20th Century, perhaps the major American practitioner of the art between the time of Edgar Allan Poe and Stephen King. Born into an upper middle class family in Providence, Rhode Island, Howard Phillips Lovecraft (1890-1937) had a lonely childhood, but read voraciously from his earliest years. He soon became interested in science and astronomy and began penning stories, poetry, and essays in great profusion, publishing them himself when no other market was available. The advent of Weird Tales in 1923 gave him a small outlet for his work, and he attracted a large number of followers, with whom he exchanged literally tens of thousands of letters, many of them quite lengthy. A number of these young correspondents eventually became professional writers and editors themselves. Lovecraft's fame began spreading beyond fandom with the publication of his first significant collection, The Outsider and Others, in 1939, two years after his untimely death. Book jacket.",['S. T.

Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society,"“The only stability possible is stability in motion.”—John William Gardner In his classic treatise Self-Renewal, John W. Gardner examines why great societies thrive and die. He argues that it is dynamism, not decay, that is dramatically altering the landscape of American society. The twentieth century has brought about change more rapidly than any previous era, and with that came advancements, challenges, and often destruction. Gardner cautions that “a society must court the kinds of change that will enrich and strengthen it, rather than the kind of change that will fragment and destroy it.” A society’s ability to renew itself hinges upon its individuals. Gardner reasons that it is the waning of the heart and spirit—not a lack of material might—that threatens American society. Young countries, businesses, and humans have several key commonalities: they are flexible, eager, open, curious, unafraid, and willing to take risks. These conditions lead to success. However, as time passes, so too comes complacency, apathy, and rigidity, causing motivation to plummet. It is at this junction that great civilizations fall, businesses go bankrupt, and life stagnates. Gardner asserts that the individual’s role in social renewal requires each person to face and look beyond imminent threats. Ultimately, we need a vision that there is something worth saving. Through this vision, Gardner argues, society will begin to renew itself, not permanently, but past its average lifespan, and it will at once become enriched and rejuvenated.",['John W.

Final Witness,"The grandson of J.R.R. Tolkien makes a thrilling debut as a novelist in this suspenseful courtroom drama that will have you guessing to the very end. “Don’t let the author’s last name confuse you, for there are no Hobbits in this debut novel by the grandson of J.R.R. Tolkien, only a wonderful story of family, relationships, and suspense. . . . Part English cozy, part family saga, part courtroom drama, this genre-bending work of fiction is touching and enchanting.” —Booklist (starred review) “The book is fast-paced and crisply plotted, with Tolkien elegantly piecing together the different perspectives and introducing unexpected twists.” —Publishers Weekly “Tolkien’s skill as a storyteller is worthy of notice in this taut, well-paced legal thriller. The excellent courtroom drama and well-drawn, believable characters make this a good choice. . . . With an easily recognizable surname, a formidable Oxford education, and a successful career as a London barrister, the grandson of the author of The Lord of the Rings is bound to create a stir with this debut novel.” —Library Journal One summer night, two men break into an isolated manor house and kill Lady Anne Robinson. Her son, Thomas, convinces the police that his father’s beautiful personal assistant sent the killers, but Thomas is known for his overactive imagination, and he has reasons to lie. Thomas’s father, Sir Peter Robinson, the British minister of defense, refuses to believe his son. Instead, he marries his assistant, Greta Grahame, and will be giving evidence for the defense at her trial. He will be the final witness. Author Simon Tolkien successfully combines legal suspense and psychological tension in this sharply etched portrait of four people whose lives are changed by a murder. Alternating between the trial in London’s Central Criminal Court and private moments among the characters, Tolkien expertly describes the art of the trial, the clash between Britain’s social classes, and, most notably, the complexity of family relations. Who is telling the truth—the new wife or the bereaved son? What will Sir Peter tell the court? With tantalizing ambiguity, Tolkien keeps readers guessing about the true motivations of these characters until the final witness.",['Simon Tolkien'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dBYC01Wa55EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=dBYC01Wa55EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Final+Witness&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,2002-12-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dBYC01Wa55EC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],2.0
