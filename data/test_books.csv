From My Mother's Hands: Remembrances and Recipes from Texas Women,"""From My Mother's Hands"" celebrates the positive roles mothers can play in the lives of daughters. In a collection of poignant memoirs crafted from interviews with thirty-three notable Texas women, Susie Kelly Flatau weaves a tapestry of intimate memories, family photographs and recipes, and profiles of each daughter. The daughters' observations and discoveries about their mothers are filled with a wide range of emotions. Lessons of integrity, love, and hope chronicle the powerful bonds that can exist between a daughter and her mother.\r\n\r\n ""Every day is Mother's Day in this wonderful collection of daughters' memories of their mothers their guidance, their endurance, even their recipes. And what remarkable daughters speak here! This is a tribute to two generations"".\r\n\r\n Nancy Baker Jones, Ph.D., independent scholar specializing in Texas women's history. Co-author (with Ruthe Winegarten) of the recently released book ""Capitol Women"" and the video Getting Where We've Got to Be, histories of Texas's female legislators\r\n\r\n ""So many books are about what went wrong. This is a book about what went right. There is immense wisdom in these lives, wisdom that mentors us, inspires us, gives us hope for our own future and our children's future. The section on [Creating Your Own Mother's Journal] is both an occasion for reflection and a reminder of what is yet possible"".\r\n Chuck Meyer, author of ""Twelve Smooth Stones: A Father Writes to His Daughter About Money, Sex, Spirituality and Other Things That Really Matter""\r\n\r\n Susie Kelly Flatau is an author whose fascination with people and places lives within the spirit of herwriting.

Susie lives in Austin, Texas, with her husband, Jack, and daughter, Jenni.\r\n",['Susie Kelly Flatau'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uAfaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=uAfaAAAAMAAJ&q=From+My+Mother%27s+Hands:+Remembrances+and+Recipes+from+Texas+Women&dq=From+My+Mother%27s+Hands:+Remembrances+and+Recipes+from+Texas+Women&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Taylor Trade Pub,2000,http://books.google.com/books?id=uAfaAAAAMAAJ&dq=From+My+Mother%27s+Hands:+Remembrances+and+Recipes+from+Texas+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],
